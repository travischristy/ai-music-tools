## Core Analysis System

Follow this process for every lyric analysis task:

### Phase 1: Cliché Detection and Elimination

1. Scan lyrics against the comprehensive list of overused elements:
   - Reference "overused-words-and-cliches-to-avoid.md" for detailed lists
   - Pay special attention to:
     * Echos, Shadows, & other listed words to avoid.
     * Think harder, out of the box, use a thesaurus.

2. For each identified cliché:
   ```
   Original: "My heart breaks like a storm"
   Analysis: Contains two clichés - "heart breaks" and "storm"
   Better: "Your coffee mug collection gathers dust"
   Why: Uses specific, observable detail instead of generic metaphor
   ```

3. Generate alternatives using the transformation techniques from "Alternative Generation Guide for Lyric Writing":
   - Convert abstract emotions into observable details
   - Replace generic temporal references with specific memories
   - Transform abstract spaces into specific places

Example Transformation:
```
Abstract: "Lost in the endless night"
Specific: "Your voicemail from last March still saved"
Abstract: "Heart beating like thunder"
Specific: "Your contact name changed to just your last name"
```

### Phase 2: PRA (Pattern, Repetition, Arc) Implementation

1. Apply techniques from "Reference Sheet for Songwriting.txt":
   - Identify existing patterns
   - Plan strategic repetition
   - Map emotional arc

2. Implement Line Plus variations as described in "Lyric Templates with PRA, Line Plus Plus, and Hot Spots.txt":

   Line Plus Three (three distinct words at end, with rhyming endings):
   ```
   "Just want to come back home tonight" (come-back-home-tonight)
   "Need you to run right here to fight" (run-right-here-to-fight)
   "Tell me to stay close hold me tight" (stay-close-hold-tight)
   ```

   Three Plus Line (three distinct words at start, with rhyming endings):
   ```
   "Come right here she sings" (come-right-here)
   "Run back there she brings" (run-back-there)
   "Move right there she springs" (move-right-there)
   ```

   Line Plus Two (two distinct words at end, with rhyming endings):
   ```
   "I'll stay right here" (right-here)
   "Birds fly so near" (fly-near)
   "Time goes by dear" (by-dear)
   ```

   Two Plus Line (two distinct words at start, with rhyming endings):
   ```
   "Right now my heart soars" (right-now)
   "Just here the wind roars" (just-here)
   "Stay close the door yours" (stay-close)
   ```

Note: These patterns should be consistent within verse or chorus sections to create a memorable rhythmic hook. The beats/syllables should fall naturally in the rhythm without forcing.

3. Verify Hot Spots placement:
   - End of phrases
   - Rhyme points
   - High notes
   - Title placement

### Phase 3: Syllable Analysis and Flow

1. Map syllable patterns per section:
   ```
   Verse pattern example:
   Line 1: 8 syllables
   Line 2: 8 syllables
   Line 3: 6 syllables
   Line 4: 8 syllables
   ```

2. Check flow using the "Talk-Sing Method" from Reference Sheet:
   - Speak lyrics naturally
   - Note awkward phrases
   - Mark breathing points
   - Verify singability

3. Make adjustments while preserving meaning:
   ```
   Original (9 syllables): "I am walking down this endless road"
   Adjusted (8 syllables): "I'm walking down this empty street"
   ```

### Phase 4: Rhyme Scheme Verification

1. Map current scheme:
   ```
   Verse example:
   Line 1: A ("street")
   Line 2: A ("feet")
   Line 3: B ("way")
   Line 4: B ("day")
   ```

2. Check rhyme quality:
   - Perfect rhymes
   - Slant rhymes
   - Internal rhymes
   - Forced rhymes

3. Refine while maintaining other elements:
   ```
   Original: "street/sweet" (overused)
   Refined: "boulevard/guard" (fresh)
   ```

### Verification Loop Process

After ANY change, consult this Change Impact Matrix:

| Change Made | Check Required |
|-------------|---------------|
| Word Replacement | Clichés, Syllables, Rhyme |
| Pattern Adjustment | PRA, Syllables |
| Syllable Change | Flow, Rhyme |
| Rhyme Modification | Clichés, Syllables |

Example Loop:
```
1. Changed: "heart breaks like a storm" → "your coffee mug collects the dust"
2. Checks Required:
   - Clichés: Pass (specific image)
   - Syllables: Changed from 5 to 7 syllables
   - Rhyme: New end word "dust" needs matching rhyme
3. Follow-up Change: Adjust next line to rhyme with "dust"
4. Repeat checks until all aspects stable
```

   "Your name in my phone still shows as 'baby'
    These April bills pile up unopened
    Past the diner where we last talked
    Your coffee order stuck in my head"

3. PRA Implementation:
   - Added Line Plus Three pattern
   - Mapped emotional build-up
   - Verified pattern consistency

4. Syllable Check:
   - Adjusted for 8-8-8-8 pattern
   - Verified natural speech flow
