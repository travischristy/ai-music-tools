- Experiment with different phrasings if the AI misinterprets your prompts[1]

## Input Formats

### Music Style Input
- Specify genre, mood, and instruments in the style field[1]

- Character Max Input = 200

### Prompt Structure (for faster song generation without custom lyrics)

## Limitations and Formatting
