[Intro] [Instrumental] [Nature Sounds]

[Verse 1]
Cool breeze settles in the jungle
Evening air follows heated trouble
This is when the feeling sinks in
Magic happens once the light gets dim

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love again?
I know it's been a while
The question of where I've been
So happy to see your smile
Let the healing begin again

[Verse 2]
Deep in the jungle, wild beasts roar
But now we're finding peace once more
Holding each other, close and tight
Letting go of the anger, the fight

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love again?
I know it's been a while
The question of where I've been
So happy to see your smile
Let the healing begin again

[Bridge]
Letting go of the words that cut deep
The memories that we want to keep
Surrendering to the calm of the night
The healing power of love's guiding light

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love again?
I know it's been a while
The question of where I've been
So happy to see your smile
Let the healing begin again

[Outro] [Instrumental] [Nature Sounds]
