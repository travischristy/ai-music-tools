1. **Compound Metaphors**
Frequently involve two nouns or a noun+verb combination creating abstract imagery:
- "Shattered + Dreams"

- "Burning + Bridges"
- "Empty + Streets"

2. **Time/Memory Constructs**
Words/phrases relating to memory and temporal concepts:
- "Lost in Time"

Technical issue: These bypass specific emotional description in favor of generic physiological metaphors

2. **Time-Based Progressions**
- "Moment by moment"
