# Expert Songwriting Toolbox: Lyrics and Musicality

This toolbox focuses on techniques for writing lyrics and notating them with musicality, style, and emotion, categorized by their effect on **hype, tension, and implied tension**. The techniques are drawn from the provided sources, which primarily focus on commercial pop music.

### Lyrics 

#### Hype

* **Scope**: Use general, big-picture statements to increase hype. Use specific details and storytelling for lower hype.
* **Power Words**: Words that evoke a strong emotional reaction or have a deeper meaning increase hype. 

#### Tension

* **Contentual Tension**:
    * **Storytelling**: Building a narrative within the lyrics can create tension, particularly in genres like country and folk. 
    * **Cliffhangers**: Ending a lyrical section with a surprise, question, or an incomplete thought creates anticipation.
* **Structural Tension**:
    * **Pickups**:  Beginning a vocal line slightly before a new section starts builds anticipation.
    * **Split Lines**: Pausing mid-line instead of at the end of sentences creates tension.

#### Implied Tension 

* **Contentual Implied Tension**:
    * **Contrasting Energy**: Juxtapose low-energy lyrics with high-energy music (or vice versa) to imply boredom, apathy, or detachment.
    * **Sting**: In a personal narrative, add a line that elevates the specific situation to a relatable, general message.
* **Structural Implied Tension**:
    * **Unbalanced Phrasing**: Break away from standard four-line blocks by writing blocks with three or five lines.
    * **Split Lines**: Pausing mid-line within a section, and occasionally singing a complete line as a "sting".

### Lyrics and Sections

* **Intro**: Often instrumental, but can include vocal improvisations to set the mood.
* **Verse**: Focus on specific details and descriptions to introduce characters and situations.
* **Pre-Chorus**: Build tension with techniques like split lines that lead into the chorus.
* **Chorus**: Use power words and general statements to emphasize the main idea and increase hype.
* **Bridge**: Can introduce a surprise element, change writing style, or shift the narrative. 
* **Ending**: Adapt lyrics to the musical ending, using techniques like returning to beginning lyrics, emphasizing high energy, or fading out with ad-libs.

### Musicality

The sources emphasize that **lyrics are an instrument** that contributes to the overall energy curve of the song. 

#### Vocal Techniques for Hype 

* **Pitch**: Higher pitches generally correspond to higher hype.
* **Variety**: Melodies with more different notes have higher hype.
* **Vocal Modes**: Use different vocal techniques like neutral voice, falsetto, speech, and belting to create varying levels of hype.
* **Effects**: Twang, vibrato, ornamentations, and distortion can be used to increase hype.

#### Vocal Techniques for Tension

* **Ascending Melodies**: Gradually rising pitch creates tension.
* **Change Vocal Mode**: Shifting to a mode with higher hype mid-section builds tension.
* **Tense Notes**: Hitting notes like the third or seventh of a dominant chord adds tension.
* **Gradual Effects**: Slowly adding twang or distortion to the voice increases tension.
* **Displays of Skill**: Fast rapping or extended phrases without breaths can create tension.

#### Vocal Techniques for Implied Tension

* **Subtract Melody**: Silence or rests in the vocal line create a sense of anticipation.
* **Tense One-Note Melody**:  Use a note outside the tonic triad for a one-note melody, occasionally resolving to a chord tone for a "sting".
* **Space**: Pauses and breaths in the vocal line, particularly in ballads, create tension.
* **Attitude**: Contrasting vocal energy with the music (e.g., low-energy vocals over high-energy music) implies tension.

### Integrating Lyrics and Musicality

* **Line Plus Technique**: This technique involves using a specific rhythmic and melodic pattern in conjunction with three-syllable words or phrases. It's a powerful way to create catchy and memorable hooks.
* **Hotspots**:  Points in the melody that naturally attract attention, like the end of a phrase, rhymes, or high notes. Combine these with lyrical elements for a stronger impact.
* **Shape-Shifting**: Repeating a melodic pattern but shifting it up or down the scale adds variety while maintaining familiarity.

This toolbox provides a foundation for writing lyrics and notating them with musicality. Remember that **all elements work together**, and adjusting one element will likely necessitate changes in others to maintain the desired energy and tell a cohesive story. Experiment with these techniques, analyze your favorite songs, and continue to develop your unique songwriting voice.
