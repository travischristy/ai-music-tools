[Intro]
[Gentle acoustic guitar, piano]

[Verse 1]
[Soft, intimate]
Morning light breaks through
Gentle breeze whispers new
(Whispers new)                # Echo effect
Time slows down right here
As the clouds disappear
(Clouds fade away)            # Backup vocals

[Chorus]
[Adding harmonies]
Here we are
(Here we are)                 # Call and response
Under stars
(Under starlight)             # Backup vocals with variation
Finding peace
In the breeze
(In the cool breeze)          # Echo with slight variation

[Bridge]
[Intimate with harmonies]
Everything falls away
(Falls away)                  # Echo
In this moment we'll stay
(We'll stay)                  # Echo

[Outro]
[Peaceful fade]
Let the evening unfold
As the day turns to gold
(Turns to gold)               # Final echo

[End]
[Natural fade out]
