    - `10_Core_Principles/20_Songwriting_Workflows.md`

### A. The Addiction Formula (Master Energy Management System)
- **Key Concepts**: Gratification vs. Anticipation psychology, Energy Curve as the governing principle.
- **Core Components**:
    - **Hype** (static energy level)
    - **Tension** (gradual energy increase)
    - **Implied Tension** (noticeable omission)

## II. SYSTEMATIC WORKFLOWS & SONG STRUCTURE
- **Summary:** Outlines the end-to-end process for creating a song, from concept to final generation, using architectural frameworks.
- **Primary Source:** `10_Core_Principles/10_The_AI_Assisted_Artisan.md`

### A. The Hollywood Structure (3-Act Energy Distribution)
- **Key Concepts**: The most effective pattern for listener engagement, borrowing from screenwriting.
- **Structure**:
    - **Act 1 - Setup**: Intro, Verse 1, Pre-Chorus, Chorus 1 (smallest peak).
    - **Act 2 - Confrontation**: Verse 2 (must be bigger), Pre-Chorus 2, Chorus 2, Bridge.
    - **Act 3 - Resolution**: Final Chorus (ultimate climax), Outro.

### B. Universal Song Structures & Devices
- **Key Concepts**: Definitions and energy functions of all standard song sections (Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc.).
- **Device Integration**: Strategic placement of Dynamic, Harmonic, Melodic, Rhythmic, and Textural devices to serve the energy curve.

### A. Advanced Lyrical Techniques
- **"Show, Don't Tell" (Song Furniture)**: Using specific, sensory details over abstract statements.
- **Power Words & Strategic Placement**: Placing impactful words in positions of structural power.
- **Rhyme Schemes & Pacing**: Using rhyme and syllable counts to control emotion and flow.

### B. Song Maps & The Writable Idea
- **Key Concept**: Title + Development Strategy = Writable Idea.
- **The Seven Universal Maps**: Tension Response, Problem Declaration, Time Zones, Places, Roles, Twist, Literal Figurative.
- **3D Lyrics**: Moving beyond static description to create a dynamic plot using techniques like "Recoloring."
