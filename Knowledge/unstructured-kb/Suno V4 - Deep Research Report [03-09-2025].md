# Suno V4 - Deep Research Report [03-09-2025]

**Introduction**

Suno AI is a cutting-edge text-to-music generator that can produce complete songs – including vocals, lyrics, instrumentation, title, and even album art – from a simple prompt. Its latest model, **Suno V4** (released November 2024), represents a major leap forward in quality and features over previous versions. With V4, users (even on free accounts) can create full-length songs up to around four minutes long, with noticeably cleaner audio and sharper, more coherent lyrics compared to version 3.5. This guide provides an in-depth look at Suno V4’s unique capabilities, tips for optimizing your inputs (prompts and lyrics) for the best results, an overview of its technical strengths and quirks, as well as best practices and pitfalls to avoid. Whether you’re experienced with generative AI or new to AI music, this resource will help you craft well-tuned prompts that yield high-quality songs.

**Unique Features of Suno AI V4 (Improvements from Previous Versions)**

Suno V4 introduces significant enhancements and new functionality that set it apart from earlier releases. Most notably, V4 delivers *cleaner audio, sharper lyrics, and more dynamic song structures* than the V3 series. This means the generated music has higher fidelity with less noise or muddiness, the vocals/lyrics are more intelligible, and the compositions feel less repetitive – incorporating varied sections like bridges or breakdowns more naturally. V4 also increased the possible song length; users can now get full four-minute tracks rather than shorter clips, allowing more complex song progressions. Another headline feature is improved lyric quality – V4’s vocals enunciate lyrics more clearly and stay closer to the intended words, reducing the garbled or mumbled singing that earlier models sometimes produced.

In addition, Suno V4 rolled out several new tools and upgrades in the accompanying web/app platform. One is the **“Remaster”** function, which lets you take a song generated by an older model and re-generate it using V4’s engine for a quality boost. This isn’t a simple audio filter – it actually reconstructs the song with the new model, often improving fidelity (though it may alter the vocals or subtle elements). Another new feature is **Lyrics by *ReMi*** – an assistive lyric-writing model introduced in V4 to help users craft creative song lyrics. Within the Suno app’s Custom mode, you can click “Write with Suno,” select the *ReMi* model, and just describe the theme or idea for lyrics; the AI will generate lyrical verses in line with your description. This helps users who aren’t confident writers to start with AI-suggested lyrics, which they can then refine.

V4 also expanded the popular **Cover** and **Persona** features using the new model. *Covers* allow you to upload your own audio (up to ~2 minutes) and have Suno reinterpret it in a new way guided by a prompt. Essentially, you can feed an existing melody or reference track and ask Suno to generate a “cover” or variation – useful for style transfer or extending ideas. *Personas*, on the other hand, let you save the “essence” of a generated track (its vocal style, instrumentation and overall vibe) and apply that persona to future generations for a consistent sound. This is like creating a virtual band or artist profile; songs made with the same persona aim to have a similar voice and style. Do note, however, that personas will also carry over any quirks from the source track – if the original had some distortion or oddities, the persona might recreate those. So it’s best to create personas from songs you really like in terms of quality. Suno V4 even generates **AI cover art** images to accompany your songs, with more creative and eye-catching designs than before. For example, a dreamy song might come with a surreal pastel artwork (see image below). This integration of audio and visual AI adds to the end-to-end creative experience.

*Example of AI-generated cover art from Suno (V4 introduced improved cover art designs to match the song’s “vibe”).*

Overall, Suno V4’s unique functionality lies in its ability to take a high-level idea (a text prompt or a set of lyrics) and produce an entire song with structure, vocals, lyrics, instruments, and style – all in one go. The improvements in audio clarity, lyric intelligibility, and structural variety make the songs feel more “real” and listenable than earlier AI music attempts. In the next sections, we’ll explore how to get the most out of these capabilities by crafting effective inputs and using Suno’s tools wisely.

**Optimizing Your Inputs for the Best Music Generation Results**

To unlock Suno V4’s full potential, it’s important to provide well-thought-out inputs. There are two main parts to your input in Suno’s Custom mode: a **Music Prompt (Description/Style)** and the **Lyrics**. In Standard mode you only give a single prompt and the AI will invent lyrics and style for you, but Custom mode is recommended for the best control. Below, we break down how to optimize both prompts and lyrics, as well as how to guide the model’s style and tone.

- **Crafting Descriptive Prompts (Genre, Mood, Style):** In the music description prompt, be specific about the *genre*, *mood*, and any key *elements* you want. Suno responds well to prompts that set a clear vibe. For example, instead of a vague prompt like “a song about love,” you might say: *“an upbeat 90s-style pop punk song with energetic guitars, about young love and freedom”*. Including genre and era cues (“90s pop punk”), instrumentation or sound adjectives (“energetic guitars”), and mood keywords (“upbeat”, “freedom”) gives the AI strong guidance. In general, **mentioning a musical style or mix of styles** (e.g. *soulful R&B with electronic chillwave elements*), along with a mood or atmosphere (e.g. *dreamy, melancholy*), yields more on-target results. The prompt can also specify tempo or energy (e.g. *slow ballad*, *fast tempo dance track*) and even era or production style (e.g. *80s synthwave vibe*, *70s classic rock sound*). Suno’s model has been noted to follow era/genre hints quite well – for instance, saying “70s, Hammond organ pad” will likely produce a classic 70s rock feel.

    *Best Practice:* **Include 2–3 descriptive keywords for genre and mood.** For example: “Jazz-influenced lo-fi hip hop beat, warm and nostalgic mood.” Also add any standout element you want (a specific instrument, a vocal quality, etc.). This ensures the AI has a clear target style. Avoid overly long or rambling descriptions; concise, style-focused prompts work best. *Tip:* Suno currently has a bias toward mainstream pop/rock sounds by default, so if you want something experimental or uncommon (e.g. avant-garde jazz or an odd time signature), you must explicitly prompt for it – and even then the model might struggle to fully escape its pop training bias.

- **Referencing Artist Styles (Use with Care):** Suno can emulate *vibes* of famous artists if you name them, e.g. “a vocal ballad in the style of Adele” or “a rap track with Kanye West and Travis Scott vibe.” Many users report that mentioning an artist or band guides the model toward that artist’s genre and vocal style. For instance, invoking *Taylor Swift* might yield a pop-country sound with storytelling female vocals. An extensive community list matches artists to styles (e.g. *Drake – introspective hip hop with male vocals;* *Metallica – intense heavy metal*). **However, note that Suno’s official guidelines caution against using real artist names directly in prompts**, likely due to copyright concerns and sometimes unpredictable results. If you do use them, treat them as style hints, not as a guarantee – Suno won’t produce an exact copy of the artist’s voice, just a similar genre feel. An alternative is to describe the style without naming the artist (for example, instead of “Billie Eilish style”, prompt for *“dark, minimalist electro-pop with whispery female vocals”*, which evokes her vibe). This avoids any potential content filter issues and can still steer the tone effectively. In short, **you can mention famous genres or even eras and scenes (like ‘Motown soul’, ‘British Invasion rock’, ‘SoundCloud trap’)** to get nuanced stylistic influence without relying on specific proper names.
- **Writing Structured Lyrics:** If you choose to input custom lyrics (rather than letting Suno generate them), spending time on lyric structure will significantly improve the song outcome. Suno V4 is adept at fitting user-provided lyrics into a melody – it will determine tune and rhythm to match your words. To help it do this well, write lyrics in a **song-like format with clear sections and line breaks**. A good approach is to divide lyrics into labeled sections such as verses, chorus, bridge, etc. For example, you might write:

```other
[Verse 1]  
Four lines of lyrics here (around 5-7 words per line)  
Another line continuing the thought  
Try to use a simple rhyme scheme (e.g. ABAB)  
Fourth line wrapping up the verse idea  

[Chorus]  
Short catchy lines that repeat!  
A big emotional hook in CAPS if desired!
```

    Using **square bracket tags** to mark sections (e.g. `[Verse 1]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`) is a recommended technique. Suno recognizes these tags as structural cues and will compose the music to have corresponding changes – e.g. it will know to make the chorus section more intense or melodic, and to transition appropriately from verse to chorus. You can even specify a section like `[Intro]` or `[Outro]` for purely instrumental openings/endings. Keep verses and choruses **brief and balanced** – for instance, verses of ~4 lines and choruses of ~2-4 lines often work well. Consistent line length (in terms of syllables/words) within a section helps the AI maintain a steady rhythm. It’s also wise to maintain a regular rhyme and meter in lyrics (they need not be complex; simple rhymes and rhythmic phrasing give the AI a scaffold to sing). A user-shared formula suggests something like: *Verse: 4 lines, ~6 words each, ABAB rhyme; Pre-Chorus: 2 lines, ~5 words each; Chorus: 4 lines, with maybe a repeated hook* – this kind of template yields a solid pop song structure that Suno can easily follow. Of course, feel free to adjust as your song needs, but avoid very long blocks of text without breaks, as the AI might not parse a wall of text into a melodic structure on its own.

- **Using Meta-Tags and Directions in Lyrics:** Beyond simply labeling sections, Suno V4 supports **“meta” instructions in square brackets within the lyrics** to influence how it generates that part. These can drastically improve the musicality of the result. For example, you can insert instrument or style cues like `[Guitar Solo]`, `[Piano Break]`, `[Bass Drops]` to tell the AI to include an instrumental section there. If you want a certain vocal style at a point, you could use tags like `[Female Vocal]` or `[Whispered Verse]` or `[Shouted]` – the model will attempt to change the delivery accordingly (whispering softly in a verse, or shouting a line for intensity). There are also tags for dynamics or special effects: e.g. `[Crescendo]` to have a build-up, `[Soft Outro]` for a gentle ending, or tags like `[Catchy Hook]` to signal an ear-catching repeated phrase. These meta-tags act as *stage directions*, guiding the AI’s composition decisions.

    Another powerful trick is using **asterisks (`*`) for sound effects or ambience**. Surround a word or phrase with `*` and Suno may interpret it as a sound effect to include. For instance, `*gunshots*` in the lyrics could prompt the model to add gunshot sounds in the background at that moment. Similarly, `*thunder*` might create a thunder sound, or `*crowd cheering*` could add crowd noise. This can greatly enhance storytelling (imagine a song that opens with *rain* sound effects if you write “*rainfall*” at the intro). Use this sparingly and only for obvious sounds, since it’s not an exact science – but many users have found it effective for common effects.

    You can also use **ALL CAPS for emphasis** in lyrics. If you write a line in all capital letters (with perhaps an exclamation mark), the AI will treat that as a cue to sing it more loudly or passionately. For example, a chorus line “**I’M NEVER LOOKING BACK!**” in caps will likely be belted out more intensely by the model. This is great for highlighting the emotional peak of a chorus or any line you want to stand out. Combining these formatting techniques can yield very nuanced results – e.g. `[Chorus - ALL CAPS]` could be used to ensure the chorus section is sung powerfully, and you might add *sound effects* in that section for drama. Overall, don’t be afraid to annotate your lyrics with brackets and formatting; Suno V4 is trained to utilize these cues, making your song feel more “produced”. (For a reference, the community has compiled lists of supported meta-tags on sites like the Suno AI Wiki.) It’s a unique feature of Suno that you can *guide the composition* to this degree through the prompt itself.

- **Tuning the Style and Tone:** Apart from the text you provide, Suno V4 will make a lot of creative decisions on its own – the specific melody, the chord progression, the vocal melody line, etc. While you can’t directly specify exact notes or chords (fine-grained control is limited), you can influence these indirectly. If you have a desired tempo or energy level, mention it in the description (e.g. *“mid-tempo groovy funk”* or *“slow romantic ballad”*). You can even include tempo markings or mood adjectives like “120 BPM” or “fast 4/4 beat” in the style prompt – the AI doesn’t guarantee precision, but it will attempt to match the feel (there is no guarantee it will hit a specific BPM, but saying “fast punk at 180bpm” will at least push it to a faster feel). For chord progressions, some advanced users have experimented with including chord names in lyrics, like writing `[G#m]` at the start of a line to nudge the harmony. The model may interpret that and bias the music toward that chord (especially if multiple chords are given in sequence), but the support for explicit chords is rudimentary. You can try simple progressions (e.g. put chord tags like `[Am] [F] [C] [G]` at the top of a section to hint a 4-chord loop) – just note that results vary and Suno might not always obey exactly or might ignore complex chord instructions. In general, it’s better to describe the vibe of the harmony (e.g. “somber minor key” or “bluesy progression”) than to expect exact chords.

    For **vocal tone**, use adjectives in your prompt and lyric tags: e.g. *“husky male vocals”*, *“ethereal whispered vocals”*, or specify `[Female Vocal]` tag in a section if you want a female-sounding singer for that part. Suno’s default is often a pop vocal tone, but it can do rap/spoken word if lyrics are structured accordingly (you might label a section `[Rap]` or write lyrics that are clearly rap bars to get the model to drop the melody and rhythmically speak them). In fact, V4 is reported to handle rap and hip-hop better if prompted with those genres, though sometimes flow can be generic. If you want multiple voices (like duet or backing vocals), you could try tags such as `[Duet]` or `[Backup vocals]` – the model may attempt layered vocals. Another subtle control is **capitalization for certain words**: if you want a word really stressed or elongated, putting it in caps or stretching it (e.g. “loooove”) could make the singer hold or emphasize it – but use that sparingly to avoid unnatural results.

Finally, remember that **prompting is an iterative process**. Even with all these optimizations, generating music can involve some randomness. It’s normal to not get the perfect result on the first try. Suno’s own community notes that you shouldn’t expect every detail of your prompt to be hit in one go – sometimes it takes a few attempts or minor tweaks to get the vibe you want. Don’t be discouraged by a less-than-ideal output; often re-running the generation with the same input can yield a different (possibly better) variation, due to the stochastic nature of the model. Now that we’ve covered how to craft inputs, let’s look at Suno V4’s technical strengths and limitations – understanding these will further inform how to set expectations and adjust your approach.

**Technical Strengths and Constraints of Suno AI V4**

Suno V4 is one of the most advanced AI music models publicly available, but like all AI systems it has particular strengths *and* limitations. Knowing these will help you leverage what it does well and work around what it doesn’t.

- **Strengths of Suno V4:** The model’s biggest strength is its **end-to-end capability** – it generates composition, arrangement, lyrics, and vocals together. This holistic approach means the output is usually a well-blended song (you won’t have to stitch vocals over music; it’s all integrated). V4 especially excels at mainstream musical styles (pop, rock, hip-hop, EDM, R&B, etc.), often producing impressively *polished-sounding choruses and hooks*. The upgrade to V4 brought more coherent lyrics and better enunciation, so you can often understand the sung words, which is a notable achievement in AI music. The model is also quite good at adapting to user-provided lyrics – it can take a custom lyric and create a fitting melody and accompaniment for it, even for languages other than English. Users have been “astounded” that it manages to sing non-English lyrics in a sensible way and fit them musically. (Expect some accent or pronunciation quirks for less common languages, but the fact that it attempts multi-lingual singing is a plus.) Another strength is creative **genre mixing**: because the AI was likely trained on a wide variety of music, you can prompt unusual combinations (e.g. *“grunge 70s bagpipe music”*) and sometimes get fascinating new sounds that “have never been heard before”. V4 is also better at maintaining a **logical song structure** (intro, verses, chorus, etc.) on its own, especially if you prompt it with a story or progression. The inclusion of features like ReMi lyric assist and cover/personalization tools indicate the ecosystem is strong – you’re not just getting a raw model but a platform with supporting utilities to refine your music.
- **General Constraints:** Despite the improvements, **Suno V4 still has limitations in control and consistency**. The generation process has a lot of randomness (“RNG”), which means you might need to attempt multiple generations to get a result that matches your vision. Sometimes the model will misinterpret or partially ignore parts of the prompt – e.g. you might request a specific instrument or theme and not immediately hear it in the output. It’s been observed that the AI can *hallucinate* or mix up lyrics: occasionally singing the wrong line, repeating a verse incorrectly, or even jumbling words into nonsensical phrases that sound like “strange new languages”. These quirks are part of the generative process. The model might also drop words or go “la-la” if it runs out of lyric or gets off sync.

    Another constraint is in **musical complexity**: Suno tends to default to common time (4/4) and standard Western popular music chord progressions. Attempts to force unusual time signatures (e.g. 5/4 or 7/8) or very complex jazz chords often fail or result in the model reverting to something more familiar. There is a noted *bias toward familiar pop structures* – for instance, many songs end up using the “4-chord” pop progression and simple 4/4 rhythms by default. If you love progressive rock or avant-garde styles, you might find Suno’s outputs relatively conservative in structure. You cannot explicitly program a detailed melody or bassline; you have to influence through descriptive hints, which is an inherent limitation of a text-to-music system. Fine control like adjusting mixing levels of individual instruments or exact note sequences isn’t exposed to the user. So while you can guide the AI, you can’t fully compose through it in a deterministic way – think of it as a creative partner with a mind of its own, rather than a precise music production tool.

- **Known Biases/Quirks:** The training data influences what Suno produces. One bias mentioned by users is a tendency for songs to lean *pop-ish* even when you aim for other genres. For example, an “experimental cinematic” prompt might still come out more like a pop movie soundtrack than truly avant-garde. Instrumentation biases exist too: some users noticed that the model would add certain instruments like synth leads by default (e.g. an undesired EDM-style synth riff appearing in rock songs). In one report, Suno was “obsessed with putting [unwanted] synth solos” in many rock outputs, requiring the user to regenerate multiple times to get rid of it. Directly telling the AI “no synths” or negating something in the prompt usually **does not work** – current models don’t reliably follow negation instructions. So if the AI keeps adding an unwanted element, you might need to try phrasing your prompt differently or use the editing features after generation (more on those soon). There’s also a “familiarity bias” in play: if you feed the model your own reference audio to cover or extend, it will try to stick close to it. While this can be useful, it also means if you are extremely familiar with your original piece, the AI’s slight deviations in a V4 Remaster or Cover might sound off to you (like an uncanny valley effect where it’s similar but not exact). This isn’t the model doing anything wrong per se – it’s just not an exact clone, it’s re-generating the song anew, so small differences in melody or voice will occur.

    One quirky limitation in V4 (as of early 2025) is a **tendency for audio quality issues in some outputs**. While overall quality is better, users have noted that occasionally a generated track might have *digital distortion or artifacting* that makes it sound “nasty” or clipped. In particular, a bug has been observed where the song’s volume gradually increases over time, causing later parts of the song to sound overly loud or distorted. This seems to happen in certain genres and is a known annoyance (the waveform of the audio shows a swelling amplitude). If you encounter this, a workaround is to use the *Cover* feature on the same prompt or extend the song in parts – sometimes a re-generation fixes the audio leveling. Suno has likely been working on such issues, but it’s something to be aware of if you get a track that starts clean and ends cacophonous without obvious reason. Also, the lyric generation (when you let the AI write lyrics) is generally good at staying on theme but can produce clichés or generic lines, as any AI might. It won’t outright swear or use explicit profanity by default – in fact, Suno has content filters for offensive language. Users have found that the model may censor or alter explicit lyrics or certain sensitive topics (sometimes inconsistently). For example, it might replace a profane word with a tame equivalent or silence it. This is something to keep in mind if you are aiming for adult-themed lyrics; you may need to manually edit them after or guide the AI with milder language. In short, Suno V4’s strengths lie in accessible, high-quality song generation across popular styles, but it has biases towards the familiar and some rough edges (randomness, occasional audio glitches, less control in niche musical aspects).

**Best Practices for High-Quality Music Generation (Suno V4)**

Combining what we know about optimizing inputs and the model’s characteristics, here are key best practices and techniques to get the most out of Suno V4:

- **Plan Your Song and Use Custom Mode:** Before hopping in, take a moment to envision what you want (genre, mood, story). Then use Suno’s Custom mode which splits the **“Song Description” (style prompt) and “Lyrics” inputs** for maximum control. In Custom mode you can either write your own lyrics or let the AI suggest some (using ReMi or the standard lyric model) and then edit them. This separation lets you fine-tune the style independently from the lyrics. It’s often best to at least review or tweak the AI-generated lyrics, ensuring they have the structure and key phrases you want.
- **Write Clear Section Labels and Use Formatting Cues:** Always structure your lyric input with sections (Verse, Chorus, etc.) demarcated by labels in brackets. This helps the AI “see” the song layout and generate a more coherent composition. Use the meta-tags and formatting tricks as needed: e.g. *asterisks* for sound effects or ambiance, **ALL CAPS** for powerful lines, and specific tags like `[Guitar Solo]` or `[Bridge]` to enrich the arrangement. These act like a mini production script, and Suno will generally follow them to make the song more dynamic and interesting.
- **Be Descriptive but Concise in Prompts:** Give the model enough detail to work with, but don’t go overboard in one prompt. A good prompt might be one or two sentences packed with descriptors: *“A soulful, blues-rock ballad with emotional male vocals and a hint of gospel choir. Slow tempo, passionate and uplifting mood.”* This tells Suno the genre (blues-rock with soul), the vocal style, an additional element (gospel choir), and the tempo/mood. That’s likely to produce a better result than a long paragraph or, conversely, a single word. If using Standard mode (single prompt), make sure to include both stylistic cues and thematic/lyrical cues in that prompt since you won’t be providing custom lyrics. For example: *“An 80s synth-pop song about nostalgia and childhood memories, with female vocals. Uplifting but a bit bittersweet.”* This way the AI will generate lyrics roughly about nostalgia and choose an 80s synth-pop sound palette. Always **check for spelling and clarity** in your prompt and lyrics; typos or very complex sentences could confuse the model.
- **Leverage Suno’s Iterative Features:** Suno’s platform isn’t one-and-done – it offers ways to iterate on a song. After an initial generation, you can use the **Extend** feature to continue the song or add another section. For instance, if the song ends at 3 minutes and you want a longer outro or another verse, you can Extend from the end to generate more. You can also regenerate specific sections using the “replace section” editing tool: if one verse came out garbled, you can highlight it and ask Suno to redo it. This costs credits but, importantly, it only charges when you accept a result, allowing you to retry until satisfied. Use this to fix small issues instead of regenerating the whole song. When using Replace or Extend, keep the context in mind (the AI will try to smoothly blend the new bit with the existing parts). Another neat feature is using the **Cover** function on your own Suno-generated track as an “upscaler.” Some users do this: once a song is generated, they feed it back into Suno via Covers with the same prompt or slight tweaks – sometimes the result is a cleaner or improved version of the song, because the model recomposes it with a fresh pass (possibly mitigating issues like the volume ramp or adding variation). Just remember a cover is essentially a new generation influenced by the original, not an exact remaster, so you might get subtle differences.
- **Take Advantage of ReMi for Lyrics and Inspiration:** If you’re stuck writing lyrics or want to brainstorm, use the Lyrics by ReMi model in Custom mode. Provide a simple idea (e.g. “a heartbreak song using ocean metaphors”) and let it generate a draft. The ReMi model is designed to produce more creative or complex lyrics than the default generator, which can jump-start your songwriting. You can then edit what it gives or rearrange lines. Many find that combining human and AI writing yields the best lyrics – you maintain coherence and personal touch, while AI provides novel phrases or rhymes you might not think of. Also browse the *Discover* page in the app (community songs) for inspiration on successful prompts/lyrics others used.
- **Use Personas to Maintain Consistency:** When you hit on a song output that you love – say the vocal style or overall sound really clicks – consider making a **Persona** from it (if you’re a Pro/Premier user with access to that). A persona saves that “musical DNA” so that when you generate another song with it, the new song will try to have the same singer voice, instrumentation balance, and style. This is great for creating, for example, multiple songs for an album that all sound like the same band or artist. It addresses the randomness of voices in Suno (since otherwise each generation might pick a different vocal timbre). Just heed the earlier warning: don’t create personas from flawed songs. If a song had bad distortion or weird errors but a good idea, better to regenerate a cleaner version first, then base a persona on that clean version. Personas amplify whatever they’re given.
- **Test and Refine:** Treat each generation as a draft. Listen critically – Is the chorus catchy? Did the mood match what you wanted? If not, adjust your prompt or lyrics. Maybe the chorus lyrics weren’t strong, so the song faltered there – you could rewrite the chorus with punchier lines (in caps, perhaps) and regenerate that part. Or if the style was off (too fast, too poppy, etc.), edit your prompt to be more explicit (e.g. add “slow” or specify a subgenre). It’s a bit like directing a performer – you give notes and try again. The good thing is Suno will usually give you two variations per prompt (especially in Standard mode, it often outputs two different takes for you to choose), so you can pick the better one or even mix and match parts. Over time, you’ll develop an intuition for prompt phrasing that works best for your desired style.

**What to Avoid for Best Results (Common Pitfalls)**

To wrap up, here are some things **not** to do when using Suno V4, as they often lead to subpar outcomes or frustration:

- **Avoid Overly Vague or Overly Complex Prompts:** If you only input a single word or a very generic prompt (“song about life” or “happy music”), the AI has too little direction and will likely produce a bland, default-sounding song. Conversely, a paragraph of convoluted imagery or too many conflicting adjectives can confuse the model. Stick to clear, concise descriptions. Don’t ask for too many genres at once (e.g. “a song that is jazz but also techno and also country and classical”) – mixing two is fine, three might be pushing it. When in doubt, split it into multiple attempts focusing on one fusion at a time.
- **Don’t Rely on Negative Instructions:** As mentioned, telling Suno what *not* to do is usually ineffective. Phrases like “no drums” or “without guitar” or putting `[no synth]` in the lyrics will typically be ignored. The model focuses on what you **do** say. So phrase everything in positive terms (if you don’t want an instrument, instead of saying “no X”, try emphasizing other instruments: “piano-focused, acoustic arrangement” to imply there’s no synth). There is no official “negative prompt” feature in Suno, so avoid wasting prompt space on negations.
- **Avoid Using Real Artist Names or Lyrics Verbatim:** While referencing famous artists can guide style, *do not input actual copyrighted lyrics or expect the AI to reproduce a real song*. Not only is that against the rules (and Suno may block or alter known lyrics for legal reasons), but it also defeats the purpose of creating something original. If you mention an artist, use it only as a style hint, and avoid very unique proper nouns or offensive references that might trigger filters. Also, using an artist name too much might cause the AI to sing about that artist rather than just sound like them, which likely isn’t what you want. A subtle pitfall is that if you include an artist name in the *lyrics* field, the AI might literally sing that name, which can be awkward unless intentionally part of the song.
- **Don’t exceed the input limits or break formatting:** Suno has a limit of around **3000 characters for lyrics** input. If you try to dump an entire novel or a very long script, it won’t take it (or it will truncate). Stay within reasonable length – that limit is actually plenty (roughly equivalent to a 4-5 minute song worth of lyrics). Also, ensure your use of brackets and special formatting is clean (each `[` should have a closing `]`, etc.). Unclosed brackets or odd symbols might confuse parsing. Stick to plain text (no fancy Unicode emoticons or such in the prompt).
- **Avoid “one-shot perfection” mentality:** It’s rare to nail a perfect song on the first generation. Don’t get discouraged or assume “the model is bad” if the first try isn’t great. Many users report doing several iterations and edits – that’s normal. If you have a specific vision (like a very precise story in the lyrics or a unique musical turn), you may need to guide the AI in smaller steps: generate a base, then extend or edit. Trying to force too much into one go can overwhelm the model. It’s better to get a solid chorus and verse, then later extend for a bridge, than to demand in the prompt “include a complex bridge with key change and a long guitar solo and a quiet outro”. Break it down; use extend for the key change and solo when you reach that point.
- **Don’t create Personas from flawed outputs:** We touched on this, but to reiterate – if a particular generation had a bad quirk (weird voice, distortion, etc.), do **not** lock that in as your persona signature. That will cause future songs to replicate the flaw. Only save personas that represent qualities you want to keep. If you accidentally save a “bad” persona, it’s best to delete or not use it further.
- **Avoid ignoring the community guidelines:** Suno, like other AI platforms, has some content guidelines. Avoid prompts that encourage hate speech, extremely explicit sexual content, or violent incitement – not only for ethical reasons, but also because the model may refuse or twist the output if it detects disallowed content. If your song needs to touch on mature themes (like tragedy, violence in a storytelling sense, etc.), do so artfully and without graphic detail. This will keep you within bounds and also usually makes for better lyrics.
- **Watch out for the “familiarity trap”:** If you are using Suno to iterate on your own composition (via covers or extends of an initial idea), be aware of the *uncanny valley* effect as described by some users. The AI might produce something 90% similar to your original with 10% differences. Your brain, being very familiar with your work, might latch onto that 10% and feel the result is “wrong” or disappointing. This is a psychological bias – the AI isn’t failing, it’s just reinterpreting. The best practice here is to use the AI as a collaborator rather than expecting an identical replica. If you truly need something exact, Suno might not be the right tool for that part (you might manually record or edit those details). Use remaster and cover to enhance and explore variations, not to get a carbon copy.

By following these best practices and being mindful of what to avoid, you can significantly increase your chances of generating high-quality, usable music with Suno AI V4. The key is to guide the model firmly but patiently, and to embrace the creative spontaneity it offers while steering it with structured input. With well-crafted prompts and lyrics, plus iterative refinement, Suno V4 can produce astonishing songs at the “speed of your ideas” – truly delivering on the promise of AI-powered music creation. Enjoy experimenting, and happy songwriting with Suno AI!
