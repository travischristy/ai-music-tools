**[An official app for ios has been released!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/suno-make-music/id6480136315)**

**[Suno.com](https://suno.com/)** generates music and lyrics from a text prompt.
*Do not enter your login or account credentials in any other website or app.*

**‘Simple’ mode** uses 1 short description prompt to generate a song with lyrics and voice in a popular music style.

**‘Custom’ mode** gives more options, with separate prompts for the lyrics and music style.

Songs might not finish with just one generation, there is an option to **Extend** a clip to extend the song’s length with another audio clip.

Simple mode uses one descriptive prompt to create a song.

Switch off **Custom Mode**.

The **Song Description** can be a train of thought, a mood, or a general idea of the song.

The prompt will be interpreted by an AI language model. Lyrics and music are generated together.

Suno will return 2 clips, based on an AI generated style description and AI generated lyrics. The ‘song’ may be longer or shorter than the maximum audio length.

v1 Discord – up to 40sec *(retired)*
v2 WebApp – up to 80sec
v3 WebApp – up to 120sec
v3.5 WebApp – up to 240sec

the clips will appear on the Create page, and in your Library:

Each thumbnail is also a play/pause button for the Suno music player.

Each clip can be extended with another clip to create a longer song.

The ‘simple’ 1-prompt generates AI lyrics and a random music style.

Supply it with an idea, or specific story-scenario. Moods and genre-styles work too.

`a children's birthday sing-along about Alice visiting the zoo`

`Torchy-lounge song from the POV of a piano player working at a speak-easy who wants to go home because "It's Closing Time"`

Don’t get too specific with instrumentation or sub-genres. Use **Custom Mode** instead which splits the Style and Lyrics into separate prompts.

Custom Mode splits the text prompts into 2 panels, a **Lyric Generator** and a **Style of Music** prompt. Each has a random generator, and a text box to enter your own.

The **Lyric Generator** can build on your story idea, similar to Simple Mode.

It will generate formatted lyrics, which can be edited or expanded. Add your ideas to the box and hit **Generate Lyrics**. Of course we can edit the text before creating the song.

The Lyrics box will hold around 1250 characters, and a bit more for v3.5

**Style of Music** isn’t just the music’s genre, it also includes the mood and sub-genre descriptions, instruments, and vocal tags. it might be very simple, or a comma-separated list.

- Sultry RnB
- Upbeat Country, Female vocal
- Mississippi Blues, sparse harmonica, acoustic guitar, stomp
- bittersweet Hindustani Electro-pop, melodic sarad, ornamental singing

The Style of Music box will hold around 120 characters.

when you are finished editing, hit the Create button:

As a general rule, very short prompts seem to create the cleanest audio quality, when the creative details are left up to the AI.

In contrast, mashing-up genres and long detailed prompts of specific instruments and styles are more likely to suffer from poor audio quality.

A very short prompt seems to have more variety, while a detailed prompt may feel narrow and repetitive as if the AI has fewer options to choose from.

Suno uses a **Large Language Model** to convert the Style Prompt into music. Any word might be linked with a time period, a culture, specific song patterns, and emotions.

Don’t be limited by pre-conceived ideas of conventional music genres. It’s generative AI, not a database of samples. Explore!

Suno’s **Lyric Generator** uses ChatGPT with a custom template. It will typically generate 2 verses and 1 chorus, with around 8-lines each. This length is often too short for the 1st clip (2min) and too long for an Extend clip (1min). The actual runtime will depend on the genre and tempo of the song.

Suno’s music will be strongly influenced by the poetic-structure, including the number of syllables on each line, the pauses, and which words rhyme. AI lyrics tend to follow basic patterns which might make the song ‘generic’, even *changing the genre* to fit the lyrics.

Here are some tricks to get better results from the Lyric Generator:

**In the generator prompt**

- add a POV – even inanimate objects and abstract ideas can be the focus
- add a conflict – songs can be a moment in time where the outcome is uncertain
- add details – AI is very good at expanding on ideas, not as good at inventing original ideas.

**After the lyrics are generated**

- edit with ‘scissors’ – AI adds a lot of filler that rhymes but doesn’t contribute. Cut or change any phrase that isn’t about *your* song. Fewer words, but they all carry weight.
- play with meter and phrasing – give the lines different word-lengths. Make the verse and chorus follow different patterns.
- add line-breaks and punctuation to insert short pauses and change the rhythm. Hyphenated words will run together.
- use ad-libs – phrases in () may be interjected by the main singer, or sung by backup singers, altering the flow of the song.

There’s nothing wrong with using AI to generate song lyrics, but a human touch can always improve them.

You know…, *draw the rest of the owl*.

Suno is *wonderful* at converting a regular block of text into something musical – even user manuals and error messages make surprisingly listenable songs.

Songs made entirely of short repeated phrases (even single words) are all ‘hook’. Suno will create ridiculously catchy melodies guaranteed to get stuck in your head!

Original lyrics are copyrightable.

Suno asks that only original lyrics are used, and censors the names of recording artists and well-known song lyrics.

Cover songs and parodies are *legal*, but Suno cannot enforce the licensing and royalties owed to the publisher. Suno’s Trending pages make hosting this content legally problematic.

Of course covers will sneak through but may be removed from Suno’s website and Discord.

*a list is coming soon…*

Each ‘job’ creates 2 clips at a time. The length of the audio depends on which model is being used, the amount of lyrics, possibly the style/genre, and the random number generator that is AI.

**Full songs** are created 1 clip at a time using **Extend**. The 1st clip is the longest, the continued ‘parts’ are shorter because some of their memory is used to listen to the end of the clip before.

Each Extend generates 2 more clips, and costs credits.

When the song comes to an end, use **Get Whole Song** to stitch all the clips in 1 seamless full-length clip. Get Whole Song is free (no credits). Full songs can also be extended.

Extend a clip or a full song with another clip, up to 1min.

**This function is available in all three Suno plans: Free, Pro and Premier.**
(costs the same tokens as a regular generation)

1. click the **EXTEND** button on the clip you wish to extend

Extend from the original clip to create **Part 2**…
Extend from **Part 2** to create **Part 3**…
Extend from **Part 3** to create **Part 4**…
… and so on, until the song reaches the end.

Each generation will be labeled next to the clip’s name, but 2 clips are created with each job. You will see two **Part 2**, and two **Part 3**… If you re-roll a generation you may see more.

Selecting a continued clip will highlight the earlier parts, visible on the Create page.

on the final clip, click on the **[…]** button and choose: **Get Whole Song**. The resulting clip will have all the parts stitched together seamlessly as 1 audio clip.

TIPP: You can also use “Get Whole Song” >in between< … For example : If you have extended Part 1 with a Part 2, “Get Whole song” from these two and then Extend the result with a Part 3.

No credits are charged for Get Whole Song. The resulting clip will be labeled as a **Full Song**.

It is also possible to Extend a Full Song.

The selected clip will load into the Extend From panel. All generations will be continued from the end of this clip.

The Create Button will change to say ‘Continue’

Use the **Clear** button to unload the clip from the panel.

**New in v3** – a timestamp window appears within the Continue From panel in the format **01:55** (minutes:seconds). Use this feature to continue from an earlier time within the clip.

Extend from Time is useful when:

- the song ended too soon, and can’t continue the usual way
- there’s mistake in the text or singing
- you don’t like the end of the clip
- you want to force the song to change it’s style
- create an instrumental lead-in before lyrics.

switch on **Custom Mode** to get the 2-prompts: *Lyrics* and *Style*.

You will probably want to change the lyrics to continue with another verse and chorus. For tips see:
[My words are wrong after Continue](https://www.suno.wiki/faq/making-music/my-words-are-wrong-after-continue/)

You may change the style prompt, or keep it the same.

Singing random words from somewhere else in the song, repeating a section from the last clip, or singing gibberish hallucinations are all signs the bot has lost its place in the lyrics.

It may pick up the song later in the clip and continue as if nothing happened, or it may hallucinate and never return to the lyrics.

New in v3 – Use [Extend from Time](https://www.suno.wiki/faq/making-music/extend-from-time/) and select a timestamp where the music has a clean transition.

There is no hard rule that works every time, and it might depend on how quickly the words are sung:

- If the lyrics are slow, try picking up with the next word.
- If the lyrics are fast, try adding a line or two that have already been sung as a lead-in.

Try one technique. If it doesn’t work, try the other. Eventually you will develop an ear for which method is more likely for a particular song.

New in v3 – **Extend from Time** (formerly Continue from…) gives us flexibility to save clips that previously would have been discarded.

For example, when a clip gets cut-off mid-sentence, it’s hard to know where to pick up the lyrics in the next part. Extend from Time allows us to extend the clip from *before* the problem.

The Timestamp uses the format **01:55** (minutes:seconds). It seems best to pick a time just ahead of the point in the music.

**Extend from Time** is useful when:

- the song ended too soon, and can’t continue the usual way
- there’s mistake in the text or singing
- you don’t like the end of the clip
- you want to force the song to change it’s style
- create an instrumental lead-in before lyrics.

Extended clips use up some of their memory to ‘listen’ to the clip before. Suno hasn’t confirmed how much of the previous clip is sampled, but based on the difference between the length of the 1st clip and the continued parts we can assume it’s around 1min.

It’s possible to force a song to have an instrumental intro by starting with an instrumental prompt. Use Extend from Time to choose where the lyrics should begin, and create a Part 2 at that timestamp.

if you are extending from time on a Part 2, and the timestamp is less than 1 minute, it’s better to **Get Whole Song** and then Extend from the Full Song, so the bot can ‘hear’ more of the song…

if you want to do a sudden style change, we can extend from time (where the change should happen) then extend on *that* clip and set the timestamp super short (00:01) – this 2nd clip only has a 1sec memory of the song so it will be easy to change with a style prompt…

basically use Full Songs when you want the bot to hear the most…, and force it to forget using 2 extends in a row…

These tips can help, but remember each generation is random. It’s better to pick a ‘good’ ending than to burn through credits hoping for a ‘perfect’ ending.

Songs generate clips with endings after a full verse and chorus cycle. It can also *resist* ending if it has more of the cycle left to complete.

If the song ends abruptly within the 1st clip, you might need to structure the song with lyrics and [metatags](https://www.suno.wiki/faq/metatags/).

It can help to ‘wrap up’ the song in a final Extend. These will typically fill the clip with improvised music and lyrics before triggering an ending:

- `[Outro]`
- `[Refrain]`
- `[Finale]`
- `[Big Finish]`
- repeat the chorus twice
- repeat an ad lib or short phrase as a hook.

End tags can abruptly end of the song. Fades should be a gentler fadeout to the end, and stop the clip:

- `[End]`
- `[Fade Out]`
- `[Fade to End]`

A more aggressive method is to clear the Style and Lyric prompts completely, and prompt for an *end* only.

- Clear the **Style Prompt** and replace it with the word ‘End’.
- Add an `[End]` tag to the **Lyrics Prompt**.

Although v3.5 *can* end the song, it often doesn’t want to. It will sometimes create a false ending then start the song again.

Some users reported good results with [ending] to end a song. Its worth a try. If it still doesnt work try the following workaround:

A workaround is to switch to v3:

1. Set Extend From Time to after the final chorus or outro
2. switch to v3
3. in the lyric box type
`[end]`
nothing else
4. OPTIONAL : use the style “end, short” to force very short parts in addition to the above mentioned steps.

Some genres might to settle into a loop that doesn’t progress, or an outro that never fades out.

There’s always the option to edit your song in a DAW. Trim the end of a clip, or create a manual fade-out with free audio editing software.

Chirp has a strong random element to keep the songs interesting. Sometimes a clip won’t sing, even with the same prompt.

But if **both** clips fail to sing, there might be a problem with the style prompt or metatags.

- Chirp doesn’t know how to sing this text.
- Chirp decided the song needs a very long introduction, maybe longer than the clip.
- Chirp has received conflicting instructions and choked.
- your lyrics may be too long.

A lot of things can go ‘wrong’, so it can help to simplyfy. Remove experimental metatags, and try a simpler Style Prompt.

It can help to add a specific voice description to the Style Prompt:

- upbeat female vocals
- sultry male singer

Metatags are song instructions inside the lyrics. They use square-brackets to set them apart from the words that should be sung.

Some tags are more reliable than others, and some tags only work inside the appropriate genre.

Tags seem to work best with a maximum of 3 words.

When tagging a song section, try a short style description and a noun – the instrument or voice that should be heard.

 `[Syncopated Bass]`

Overloading the metatag can cause the instruction to be ignored, or it might be sung as part of the lyrics.

A pattern that works well for Continued songs is to have a verse and chorus in each clip. **The tags are not necessary**, the AI will build a song pattern from the lyrics with or without them.

Verses are usually rhythmic and restrained, while the chorus has more melody and energy. A chorus is usually the ‘hook’ of the song, when it repeats it makes the song feel intentional and emotional. 

Chirp’s AI-generated lyrics often use 1 verse and 1 chorus per clip.

`[Verse]`

`[Chorus]`

Add descriptive Style Words to metatags to guide how the lyrics should be sung.

- `[Sad Verse]`
- `[Happy Chorus]`

Use musical terms to influence the genre.

- `[Rapped Verse]`
- `[Powerpop Chorus]`

Metatags can ‘nudge’ the AI within the lyrics, but the lyric-structure, the current song pattern, and the Style Prompt, are stronger influences than the tags.

Even when they work, they don’t *always* work. When they do work, it can still feel like a casino.

*Pre-chorus* and *bridge* are for stray lyrics *outside* the main pattern. They build anticipation as the song transitions, and often don’t rhyme or appear to fit the meter.

- `[Pre-Chorus]`
- `[Bridge]`

AI-generated lyrics sometimes include a pre-chorus without labeling it, causing Chirp to sing it as an awkward extra line that doesn’t fit the meter.

Adding a metatag label tells Chirp *this* break in the song pattern is intentional, and it should be sung as its own pattern.

`[Verse]`
*Cruisin’ down the streets with nowhere to go
Miles of cars, it’s a never-ending show
Round and round, it’s like a crazy maze
Every parking space, a mirage, a haze**Anxiety’s building, it’s drivin’ me insane*

`[Chorus]`
*Driving in circles, looking for a spot
I’m runnin’ out of gas, I’m losing all my shots*

`[Verse]`
*Cruisin’ down the streets with nowhere to go
Miles of cars, it’s a never-ending show
Round and round, it’s like a crazy maze
Every parking space, a mirage, a haze*

`[Pre-chorus]`
*Anxiety’s building, it’s drivin’ me insane*

`[Chorus]`
*Driving in circles, looking for a spot
I’m runnin’ out of gas, I’m losing all my shots*

Pre-chorus is a lead-in to a chorus. A bridge can go anywhere. It may be enough to simply set apart the lyrics with *any* descriptive tag:

- `[Shout]`
- `[Whimsical]`
- `[Melancholy]`

There are other parts to a song than just the verse/chorus pattern.

We can influence the song structure with metatags, although the ai tends to have a mind of its own and follow it’s own pattern.

This one is notoriously unreliable. It’s probably better to describe it like an instrumental break.

- `[Short Instrumental Intro]`

A hook is a repetitive phrase or instrumental. Try repeating a short line 2 – 4 times with or without the label.

- `[Catchy Hook]`

A break is a few bars of the song where the lead instruments or singer go silent, and the accompanying instruments play. A [Break] can sometimes be used strategically to interrupt the current pattern.

- [Break]
- `[Percussion Break]`

Interlude is a useful tag to create an instrumental section within the lyrics.

- `[melodic interlude]`

An Outro can help to prime the song to end, and may create a loop to fade out in post edit.

Refrain seems to get more ‘creative’ when wrapping up the end of the song, while Big Finish may change the melody or tempo to create a climax.

- `[Outro]`
- `[Refrain]`
- `[Big Finish]`

An end tag in the lyrics may work best alone as its own clip. Clear the Style Prompt, or add ‘End’ to the style description.

- `[End]`
- `[Fade Out]`
- `[Fade to End]`

See: [How do I end the song?](https://www.suno.wiki/faq/making-music/how-do-i-end-the-song/)

As always, prompting an AI is not like paying someone to edit your music on Fiverr. The reliability of these tags can be influenced by the lyrics, the song cycle, and the AI just being random.

Songs can have instrumental sections which can be prompted the same as `[Verse]` and `[Chorus]`, but without lyrics the landmarks aren’t as clear.

An instrumental ‘break’ can replace a verse standing as its own section, or might be a short bridge in the music. These seem to work best when only one is used at a time, but adding commas inside the prompt may work. Experiment!

Prompt examples include:

- `[Break]`
- `[Instrumental Interlude]`
- `[Melodic Bass]`
- `[Percussion Break]`
- `[Syncopated Bass]`
- `[Fingerstyle Guitar Solo]`
- `[Build]`
- `[Bass Drop]`

The genre is important! You may need to describe the instrument within the Style Prompt if you want to manipulate it with metatags.

A [Bass Drop] is a common feature of EDM-genre, but it makes no sense in an acoustic guitar solo.

A [Bluegrass Banjo Interlude] will be easier to conjure within a Country-genre song, but might not work at all within an Orchestral Symphony….
Then again, it might work if a ‘banjo’ is added to the style prompt.

Suno will sometimes respond to un-singable text as a musical instrument. a few lines of punctuation-only might help to force a short instrumental solo.

Less reliable, and sometimes hilarious, try *onomatopoeic* words that mimic the sounds of the musical instruments. Often they are sung as lyrics, but sometimes trigger the intended instrument.

`[Percussion Break]   . .! .. .!   !! ... ! ! !`

[sad trombone]
waah-Waaah-WAAH

A singing voice is generated randomly for each song, but we can influence the voice in both the style prompt and in lyrics prompts.

The Style and Lyrics prompt will influence the type of voice chosen for your song:

- HipHop may default to an urban male
- Country will often sing with a western accent
- Jazz may feature a soulful female vocal
- Pop vocals are often female

Chirp can sing natively in many languages, even switching languages inside the lyrics. No special prompt is needed, the language is auto-detected.

Voice and gender can be described within the Style/Genre Prompt, although it is not always reliable:

- sultry male singer
- female narrator
- bass male vocal

Some known style-words to try, both in the style description and as lyric prompts:

- Gregorian chant
- Melismatic
- Narration
- Spoken Word
- Sprechgesang
- Emotional
- Sultry
- Resonant
- Ethereal
- Lounge Singer
- Vocaloid

Style vocals can be used as song-section metatags

- `[Female Narrator]`
- `[Diva Solo]`
- `[Gospel Choir]`
- `[Primal Scream]`
- `[Rap Verse]`

Suno doesn’t reveal details about how Chirp creates it’s voices. Some observed limitations include:

- child voices hard to prompt for (so far…)
- many languages have native-accents, but not all
- few regional accents, except when associated with a genre (Reggae, Country)

According to Suno devs, commas used in the Style Prompt will create a ‘balanced’ list where each item has an equal chance of contributing to the song.

Style Prompts without commas should follow language conventions. Typically one word modifies another, and style words may work better changed to description text.

The prompt:
`*Loud*, *Rock, Guitars*`
is different than:
`*Loud* *Rock Guitars*`

But how different? All 3 words are compatible with the genre ‘rock’ – ‘loud’ and ‘guitars’ are so common in rock these words might be unnecessary. You may get *better* results with shorter simpler prompts.

yes, metatags can use commas to make multiple commands within the same tag, but it’s usually a good idea to keep tags short or they might be sung aloud.

[soft guitar, male narrator]

A typical Style Prompt might combine short descriptions in a comma-separated list

`dreamy shoegaze, pulsing Yamaha bass, raw distorted guitars, warm synthpads, slow female whisper`

For the list to be weighted equally, the prompt needs to include a space after each comma.

Other punctuation should work similarly to commas.

Suno can add an `[Instrumental Break]` between lyrics, or can create a whole song without words or singing. Depending on your genre, you may need to encourage the AI to sing, or instruct not to sing. Here are some tips to help.

First, choose Custom mode on the Create page to get separate Lyrics and Style/Genre prompts. The Simple 1-prompt mode is not reliable for creating instrumentals.

**New in v3**, the Instrumental switch deletes any lyrics and closes the Lyric Prompt panel.

The Instrumental switch doesn’t guarantee you won’t hear hallucinations. Some genres seem to be built around vocals and are more likely to sing gibberish if no lyrics are provided. Some additional measures might be

- switch off Instrumental
- add ‘instrumental’ in the style prompt, if necessary
- add `[Instrumental]` to the Lyrics prompt as a metatag, if necessary

Instrumentals can use a verse-chorus song structure without lyrics. Style metatags can also be added to describe the music or emotional effect.

`[Dramatic Verse]`

`[Melodic Chorus]`

We can force space between the sections by adding text that can’t be sung, like unicode characters:

[Verse]
┳┻┳┻┳┻┳┻┳┻┳┻
┻┳┻┳┻┳┻┳┻┳┻┳

A `[Break]` triggers a short pause in the melody, just a few bars where the bass and percussion play. Try a `[Break]` to interrupt the singing pattern.

`[Break]`

An instrument solo is also a kind of Break:

`[Bass Drop]`

`[Percussion Breakdown]`

`[Melodic Flute Interlude]`

`[Guitar solo]`

Follow with the chorus or a new verse in the same clip to keep the voice ‘warm’. If the voice is silent for too long, Chirp may ‘forget’ how that voice should sound, and create a *new* voice to continue the song.

`[Break]`

`[Melodic Interlude]`

`[Chorus]`

Without `[Verse]` and `[Chorus]`, instrumentals still have prompts that are useful for structuring the song. Some known prompts:

- `[Break]`
- `[Melodic Instrumental]`
- `[Percussion Break]`
- `[``*instrument*``]`
- `[Beat Drop]`
- `[Build]`
- `[Breakdown]`
- `[Beat Drop]`

Use sparingly, if needed at all. Simple prompts allow Chirp to be more creative.

A string of instrumental prompts seems to create conflicts, and often does nothing at all.

Chirp will sometimes sing gibberish words. ‘Hallucinations’ happen when the singing voice goes off the intended lyrics, or when Chirp can’t find the expected lyrics to continue the song pattern.

We can’t ‘fix’ the lyrics on a clip after it was made, but we can maybe prevent the same problem happening again on regeneration.

Instrumentals can usually leave the Lyrics prompt blank, but some lyric-heavy genres will sing anyway. the solution is to add an ‘instrumental’ metatag to the lyrics text:

`[Melodic Instrumental]`

Some genres like Pop and Gospel are more likely to have songs arranged around a vocal. Chirp might hallucinate lyrics and a voice, even when you don’t give it any lyrics.

As a last resort, try adding *instrumental* as the song type in the Style/Genre prompt:

*downbeat instrumental rock*

*low-fi instrumental hiphop*

yes and no.

Duets sometimes happen spontaneously, and might continue as long as both voices are heard near the end of the clip before.

HOWEVER, the Suno voices will be random, and often the wrong gender. Duets are more of an exploit, definitely **not** a feature.

We can *try* for a duet in the style prompt:

duet
male and female duet
romantic duet

Some genres may be easier than others. Try ‘Broadway’ or ‘Musical Theater’ – genres where duets are common.

Metatags within the lyrics *might* assign multiple voices, but the gender and consistency are **not** reliable:

`[Mary]`
*This is my line…*

`[John]`
*But now I am singing…*

`[Mary and John]`
*There is a chance both of us are singing together…*

**v3.5** is more responsive to metatags. Using ‘Mr. and Mrs.’ has also worked.

Similarly, rap battles and spoken announcers can be formatted like scripted dialog.

Genre’s can be used as style words, and Suno might create a new voice just to sing that part – especially if the genre has a favorite gender:

[rapped verse] – typically male
[powerpop chorus] – typically female

With v3 it’s possible to use **Continue From Time** to start a new continuation for each vocal section. The style prompt can be adjusted at each clip.

The odds of getting the desired voice may not be any better, but it may help to preserve partially-successful clips. Once the duet pattern is established, Suno may even continue with the duet on its own, at least for a while.

Duets are **not** reliable. The voices will swap roles, you might get 2 voices that are too similar, or the song with the ‘good’ voices is not the best version.

Creating a duet is fun, but it can also soak your credits.
