# SONG WRITING TIPS



## Suno AI Tips and Tricks

#### Follow these helpful rules to write lyrics optimized for the Suno AI model's capabilities in order to get the best results:



1. **Use Structured Sections and Brackets:**
    - Example: `[Verse] In the shadows of the night`
    - `[Chorus] Rise up, let the flames ignite`
2. **Employ Creative Tags for Effects:**
    - `[Whispering vocals] Can you hear the silence creep?`
    - `[Screaming vocals] Break through the fear, let it weep!`
3. **Leverage Formatting to Emphasize Lyrics:**
    - Use **ALL CAPS** to highlight important moments:
        - Example: `NOW WE RISE!`
4. **Incorporate Meta Tags:**
    - `[Intro] Mellow piano starts`
    - `[Guitar solo] Explosive riff takes over`
5. **Experiment with Spoken Word Prompts:**
    - `[Spoken word] This is where our journey begins.`
    - **Or use parentheses**: `(This is the tale of an endless dream.)`
6. **Control Style through Descriptors:**
    - Example: `[Funky bassline] sets the groove.`
    - `[Ethereal voice] echoes through the void.`
7. **Mix Genres with Precision:**
    - “Dreamy funk, melancholic jazz, and industrial beats.”
8. **Trigger Hooks and Dynamic Shifts:**
    - `[Catchy Hook] Lost in the moment, lost in the beat.`
    - `[Drop] Silence before the storm strikes back.`
9. **Use Phonetic Spelling for Explicit Bypasses:**
    - Replace “love” with “luuv” to modify tone.
10. **Generate Variations with Detailed Prompts:**
- Example: “Gothic choir, Lo-fi beats, ghostly echoes.”

By integrating these techniques, you’ll maximize Suno AI’s lyric generation, enhancing both creative control and musical quality.





### **Syllables, word count, song structure, and rhyming patterns**

To get the best results with Suno AI, here’s how you can optimize **syllables, word count, song structure, and rhyming patterns**:

---

### **1. Word and Syllable Control:**

- **Aim for consistency**: Suno AI performs best with **4-8 syllables per line**.
    - **Example:**
        - *"Feel the fire as it grows"* (7 syllables)
        - *"In the night, the silence flows"* (8 syllables)
- **Keep verses concise:** Each line should ideally contain **5 to 8 words**.
    - If a section needs intensity, use shorter lines:
        - *"Rise up"* (2 words)
        - *"Let it break"* (3 words)
- **Varied syllable length** between verses and the chorus keeps the song dynamic. Use **longer syllables** in the chorus for impact:
    - **Verse:** Shorter lines build momentum.
    - **Chorus:** Longer lines allow the emotion to peak.

---

### **2. Rhyming Patterns:**

- Suno AI favors **AABB**, **ABAB**, or **AAAB** rhyme schemes. Choose one based on the mood:
    - **AABB (tight and predictable):**

        *"Feel the fire as it grows (A)*

        *Through the night, the darkness shows (A)*

        *Every step will light the way (B)*

        *Till the break of dawn, we sway (B)"*

    - **ABAB (story-driven flow):**

        *"In the silence, whispers stay (A)*

        *Underneath the broken sky (B)*

        *Feel the wind, it drifts away (A)*

        *Till the stars begin to fly (B)"*

    - **Internal Rhymes:** Use these sparingly to keep the lyrics playful:

        *"Every beat we keep, so deep inside the heat."*

---

### **3. Song Structure Guidelines:**

- **Standard Structure for Catchy AI Songs:**
    - **[Intro]** (Optional)
    - **[Verse 1]**
    - **[Chorus]**
    - **[Verse 2]**
    - **[Chorus]**
    - **[Bridge]** (Optional – Break or instrumental)
    - **[Chorus]** (Repeat with variations)
    - **[Outro]** (Optional fade-out or final hook)

    **Example:**

    - **[Verse]**: 4 lines, 8 words per line (AABB)
    - **[Chorus]**: 2-3 lines with longer phrasing
    - **[Bridge]**: A contrasting 2-line segment
- **More Experimental Structure:**
    - **[Intro]** – Spoken or instrumental
    - **[Pre-Chorus]** – Builds tension
    - **[Verse 1]**
    - **[Chorus]**
    - **[Verse 2]**
    - **[Drop]** – Instrumental only
    - **[Chorus]** – Modified for a stronger climax

---

### **4. Verses Before the Chorus:**

- **Pop or Electronic Music:**
    - 1 or 2 verses followed by the chorus:

        *[Verse 1] → [Chorus] → [Verse 2] → [Chorus]*

- **Rock or Ballads:**
    - 2 verses followed by the chorus:

        *[Verse 1] → [Verse 2] → [Chorus]*

- **Hip-Hop or Rap:**
    - Allow more freedom, alternating between verses and hooks:

        *[Verse 1] → [Hook] → [Verse 2] → [Bridge] → [Hook]*

---

### **5. Use Hooks Effectively:**

- Repeat key phrases or hooks in the chorus for **memorability**.
    - Example: *"We rise, we fall, we conquer it all!"*
- Use **catchy two-line refrains** before the drop or chorus:
    - *"Feel the beat rise up again,*

    *Let the rhythm take you in."*

---

### **6. Bridges for Transitions and Dynamic Shifts:**

- The **bridge** can contrast rhythm, melody, or introduce spoken word elements to build anticipation before the final chorus:
    - Example:
        - *"And as the night fades away, a new dawn will stay."*

---

With these strategies, your lyrics will match Suno AI’s processing capabilities, ensuring seamless generation with rhythm, emotion, and clarity across all sections.



## Here are a few final tips to **supercharge your lyric-writing and AI generation** with Suno:

---

### **1. Balance Repetition with Variation**

- **Repetition** makes songs memorable, but **variation** keeps them exciting.
    - Example: In the chorus, slightly tweak repeated phrases:

        *Chorus 1*: "Feel the rhythm take control."

        *Chorus 2*: "Let the rhythm free your soul."

- Repeating **key motifs** across the song adds coherence (e.g., recurring images like "light" or "ocean").

---

### **2. Create Emotional Peaks and Lows**

- Design lyrics to **peak emotionally** in the chorus or bridge.
    - Use **vivid imagery and sensory words**:
        - *"The stars bleed silver over skies of stone."*
        - **Contrast calm and explosive sections** with:

            *[Verse] whispers* → *[Chorus] soars*

---

### **3. Use Dynamic Tags to Enhance Transitions**

- Utilize Suno AI's structural tags to **guide emotional shifts**:
    - `[Whispering vocals] It's just the start...`
    - `[Screaming vocals] Let it all out—NO TURNING BACK!`
- Tag **tempo shifts** to guide AI interpretation:
    - `[Increase intensity]` or `[Slow breakdown]`

---

### **4. Embrace Imperfection**

- AI generation isn't always perfect, but that's part of the fun! Generate multiple versions—sometimes the **“mistakes” inspire the best ideas**.
    - **Curate ruthlessly**: You might go through 50 versions to find the one that *clicks.*

---

### **5. Integrate Musical Elements in the Lyrics**

- **Hint at instrumentation** within the lyrics for synergy:
    - *"The bassline drops, and I fall into the groove."*
    - *"The drums echo with a heartbeat of fear."*

---

### **6. Experiment with Genre Blending**

- Push boundaries by **combining unexpected genres**:
    - Example: **"Lo-fi ambient blues"** or **"Trap jazz with haunting vocals"**
- Be explicit in prompts, e.g.,

    *"Ethereal dream pop with industrial percussion."* This helps Suno understand your creative vision.

---

### **7. Write with the Listener’s Experience in Mind**

- Think of your song as a **journey**—build anticipation, release tension, and leave them with a lingering feeling.
    - Example: End with a **haunting outro or unresolved lyric**, leaving space for interpretation:

        *"And maybe... we'll meet again."*

---

### **8. Iterate, Iterate, Iterate**

- AI creation is a **collaborative dance**. Generate **as many versions as needed** to capture the magic. Don't hesitate to **mix and match sections from different takes** to craft the perfect piece.

---

### **The Final Word**

**Trust your instincts**—you know what sounds good. Use Suno as your creative ally, not a replacement. **Play with it, break the rules**, and don’t be afraid to take risks. At the end of the day, music is about **emotion and connection**—whether the listener hums your song or feels something deep, your job is done.

Now go make that masterpiece! 🎶
