# **Avoiding Clichés in AI-Generated Song Lyrics: A Guide to More Original and Human-Like Lyrics**

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in various creative fields, including music. AI models can now generate melodies, harmonies, and even song lyrics. However, one common criticism of AI-generated lyrics is their tendency to overuse certain words, phrases, and metaphors, making them sound repetitive, predictable, and lacking in originality. This article delves into this issue, exploring the reasons behind this overreliance on clichés and providing a comprehensive list of overused elements to avoid in future AI training and instruction.

## **The Challenge of Originality in AI-Generated Lyrics**

AI models learn by analyzing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns, and replicating them. When trained on a dataset of song lyrics, AI models often latch onto frequently occurring words, phrases, and metaphors, leading to their overuse in generated lyrics. This can result in songs that lack the freshness, emotional depth, and unique perspective that characterize human-written lyrics1.
Several factors contribute to this challenge:

- **Limited Contextual Understanding:** AI models may not fully grasp the nuances of human language and emotions, leading to the inappropriate or excessive use of certain expressions2.
- **Overemphasis on Rhyming and Structure:** AI models often prioritize rhyming and song structure, sometimes at the expense of lyrical depth and meaning. This can result in forced rhymes and predictable lyrical patterns3.
- **Lack of Personal Experience:** Unlike human songwriters, AI models lack personal experiences, emotions, and perspectives to draw upon, making it difficult to create truly original and relatable lyrics4. Human songwriters often channel their own lives, relationships, and emotions into their lyrics, giving their songs a unique and authentic voice. This personal touch is something that AI currently struggles to replicate.

## **Identifying Overused Words, Phrases, and Metaphors**

To address this issue, it's crucial to identify the specific words, phrases, and metaphors that AI models tend to overuse. By analyzing AI-generated lyrics from various sources and comparing them with human-written lyrics, we can pinpoint these clichés and understand why they sound "AI-generated." 5
For example, one AI-generated song featured the following lyrics: "In the neon glow of a midnight storm, we're racing shadows to the edge of dawn. Every heartbeat's a ticking clock, every touch is a lightning shock." 6 These lyrics, while grammatically correct and somewhat evocative, rely on common tropes like shadows, storms, and ticking clocks, which are frequently found in AI-generated content.
Another example showcases how AI can sometimes miss the mark in capturing the essence of human expression: "like totally in love with those dudes, hair in a scrunchie sipping rolling sick my chin all crunchy." 7 While attempting to mimic contemporary slang and imagery, the lyrics feel forced and lack the natural flow and wit of human-written lyrics.
Here's a breakdown of some common overused elements, categorized by theme:

## **Themes**

AI-generated lyrics often revolve around common themes such as:

- **Romantic and Intense:** Unrequited love, eternal bonds, heartbreak, longing, desire, passion.
- **Reflection and...[source](https://www.reddit.com/r/udiomusic/comments/1d8zgs5/clich%C3%A9s_in_aigenerated_lyrics/)

These themes represent fundamental aspects of the human experience, which are readily available and frequently explored in the vast datasets used to train AI models. This accessibility and prevalence in the training data contribute to their overrepresentation in AI-generated lyrics.

## **Contrasting with Human-Written Lyrics**

To further understand the limitations of AI in generating original lyrics, it's helpful to contrast them with popular human-written songs. An analysis of popular song lyrics reveals a greater diversity of themes, a more nuanced use of language, and a deeper exploration of emotions8.
For instance, while AI might default to generic expressions of love and loss, human songwriters often craft unique metaphors and imagery to convey these emotions. They draw on personal experiences, cultural references, and literary devices to create lyrics that resonate with listeners on a deeper level.
Consider the lyrics from Fleetwood Mac's "Rhiannon": "She is like a cat in the dark." 8 This metaphor, while simple, evokes a sense of mystery and intrigue that goes beyond the typical clichés found in AI-generated lyrics.
Similarly, in Dan Fogelberg's "Part of the Plan," the lyrics offer a philosophical perspective on life: "Love when you can, cry when you have to, be who you must, that's a part of the plan." 9 This kind of introspective and thought-provoking lyricism is often absent in AI-generated songs, which tend to focus on more readily available and easily replicable themes and expressions.

## **AI Song Lyric Generators**

Several AI song lyric generators are available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. These tools offer a glimpse into the current capabilities and limitations of AI in songwriting.

- **Lyrics Generator:** This platform allows users to generate lyrics in multiple languages, with features like syllable counters and rhyme suggestions10.
- **AI Lyrics Generator:** This app offers a user-friendly interface and a focus on speed and efficiency in generating lyrics11.
- **AIFreeBox AI Song Lyric Generator:** This tool emphasizes accessibility and provides a starting point for songwriting, encouraging users to refine and personalize the generated lyrics12.
- **Staccato:** This AI lyric writer is used by award-winning artists and offers features like song analysis to help users improve their songwriting skills13.

While these generators can be helpful for overcoming writer's block or exploring new ideas, they often produce lyrics that rely on familiar tropes and clichés. This highlights the need for ongoing development and refinement in AI lyric generation technology.

## **The Role of User Prompts**

The quality and originality of AI-generated lyrics are significantly influenced by the prompts provided by users. Clear, specific, and creative prompts can guide the AI towards generating more interesting and unique lyrics12.
Instead of simply asking for a "love song," users can provide details about the desired mood, theme, and style. For example, a prompt like "a melancholic ballad about lost love in a rainy city" will likely yield more evocative and specific lyrics than a generic request.
Furthermore, users can experiment with unconventional prompts, drawing inspiration from unusual sources or making unexpected connections. This can help push the boundaries of AI creativity and lead to more surprising and original results.

## **Conclusion**

AI has the potential to revolutionize songwriting, offering new tools and possibilities for creative expression13. However, the current limitations of AI in generating truly original lyrics cannot be ignored. The overreliance on clichés, the lack of personal experience, and the ethical and legal challenges surrounding AI-generated content require careful consideration and ongoing development.
By expanding and diversifying training data, incorporating contextual analysis, and encouraging emotional depth, we can guide AI models towards generating more human-like and creative lyrics. Furthermore, refining user prompts and addressing the legal and ethical considerations surrounding AI-generated music are crucial steps in ensuring that AI remains a tool that enhances, rather than replaces, human creativity.
Ultimately, the future of AI in songwriting lies in finding a balance between technological innovation and human expression. By embracing the strengths of both, we can unlock new levels of creativity and explore uncharted territories in the world of music.
