## The Cliché Detection & Replacement System

### Phase 1: Initial Detection

Before writing any lyrics, scan for these common cliché categories:

#### 1. Emotional State Clichés

❌ **Avoid These Generic Phrases:**

- "Heart (beats/breaks/skips)"
- "Soul (searching/crying/dancing)"
- "Spirit (soars/flies/rises)"
- "Feel so (alive/good/right)"
- "Burning desire/passion/love"
- "Lost in (time/love/emotion)"
- "Found myself/my way"

#### 2. Nature & Element Clichés

❌ **Avoid These Overused Metaphors:**

- "Waves crashing"
- "Stars shining"
- "Wind blowing"
- "Fire burning"
- "Storm raging"
- "Shadows falling"
- "Mountains climbing"
- "Rivers flowing"
- "Sun rising/setting"
- "Rain falling like tears"

#### 3. Time & Journey Clichés

❌ **Avoid These Temporal Tropes:**

- "Time after time"
- "Day after day"
- "Long road ahead"
- "Miles to go"
- "Path/journey ahead"
- "Cross that bridge"
- "Walking away"
- "Moving forward"
- "Looking back"

#### 4. Relationship Clichés

❌ **Avoid These Love Tropes:**

- "Can't live without you"
- "You complete me"
- "Meant to be"
- "Written in the stars"
- "Baby come back"
- "Need you by my side"
- "You're my everything"
- "Forever and always"
- "Never felt this way before"

### Phase 2: Systematic Replacement

Follow this 4-step process for every cliché you identify:

1. **Identify the emotional core** behind the cliché
2. **Generate specific details** related to that emotion
3. **Create context-specific imagery** unique to your story
4. **Verify originality** against common tropes

## Replacement Strategies by Category

### 1. For Emotional States

✅ **Instead of generic feelings, use:**

- **Physiological specifics:** "Caffeine tremor in my left hand" instead of "nervous"
- **Location-anchored emotions:** "Living room anxiety, bedroom calm" instead of "confused feelings"
- **Object-embodied feelings:** "Photo-induced nostalgia" instead of "missing the past"

### 2. For Nature Elements

✅ **Instead of generic nature, use:**

- **Specific species:** "Eastern hemlock shadows" instead of "tree shadows"
- **Named locations:** "Baxter's Creek current" instead of "flowing water"
- **Seasonal specifics:** "October frost patterns" instead of "cold weather"
- **Geological details:** "Limestone dust on boot soles" instead of "rocky path"

### 3. For Time Concepts

✅ **Instead of abstract time, use:**

- **Technology markers:** "Dial-up modem memories" instead of "things from the past"
- **Specific dates/events:** "Pre-2008-recession confidence" instead of "simpler times"
- **Personal timelines:** "Three apartments and five jobs ago" instead of "long time"
- **Object evolution:** "Second-hand watch with replaced battery" instead of "time passes"

### 4. For Relationships

✅ **Instead of romantic clichés, use:**

- **Shared routines:** "Coffee cup arrangement on the counter" instead of "missing you"
- **Digital connections:** "Your contact still pinned in my messages" instead of "can't forget you"
- **Ambient absence:** "Car seat adjusted to the wrong height" instead of "you're gone"
- **Sensory memories:** "Perfume molecules still in the closet fabric" instead of "your presence"

## Domain Shifting Technique

One of the most powerful anti-cliché techniques is to borrow language from unexpected domains:

### 1. Technology Domain

- "Recalibrating how we operate" (relationship)
- "Debugging internal code" (self-reflection)
- "Bandwidth allocation for emotional data" (communication)

### 2. Scientific Domain

- "Molecular rearrangement of priorities" (change)
- "Gravitational pull of old patterns" (habits)
- "Quantum entanglement of memories" (connection)

### 3. Architectural Domain

- "Retrofitting emotional infrastructure" (healing)
- "Load-bearing memories" (important experiences)
- "Insulation against future storms" (preparation)

### 4. Economic Domain

- "Emotional portfolio diversification" (recovery)
- "Diminishing returns on repeated apologies" (relationship)
- "Forecasting happiness with incomplete data" (hope)

## Lyric Transformation Worksheet

For each cliché you catch yourself writing, complete this process:

1. **Original cliché:** ________________
2. **Core emotion/concept:** ________________
3. **Specific context (where/when):** ________________
4. **Sensory detail (sight/sound/touch/taste/smell):** ________________
5. **Unexpected domain connection:** ________________
6. **Transformed lyric:** ________________

## Pre-Writing Cliché Prevention

Before you start writing, create these assets:

1. **Specific Setting List:** 5+ precise locations relevant to your song
2. **Unique Object Inventory:** 10+ tangible items with emotional significance
3. **Personal Lexicon:** 20+ words rarely used in songs in your genre
4. **Experience Anchors:** 5+ specific memories/moments to reference
5. **Domain-Shifted Metaphors:** 5+ comparisons using unexpected fields

## Final Verification System

After writing, conduct this 3-step check on each verse/chorus:

1. **The "Already Heard" Test:** Does any line sound familiar from other songs?
2. **The Specificity Check:** Could this detail only come from your unique experience?
3. **The Replacement Rule:** If you find a cliché, you must replace it with something at least 50% longer and more detailed.

## Remember:

- **Specific beats general**
- **Concrete beats abstract**
- **Personal beats universal**
- **Unexpected beats familiar**
- **Complex beats simple**

Original songwriting doesn't avoid emotion - it expresses emotion through fresh, specific, and authentic details that could only come from your unique perspective.
