# Template 1: Neo-Disco/Dance Pop Song Structure

## Core Concept

**Theme: Self-Empowerment Through Self-Expression**
This template creates a dance-oriented track focused on personal liberation and authenticity. The emotional arc builds from introspection to celebration, following the journey from self-discovery to confident self-expression.

## Structure Breakdown

### Intro [16 bars]

**Function:** Sets the sonic foundation and establishes groove
**Metatags:** `[Intro: Instrumental Build]` or `[Intro: Atmospheric Synth]`
**Notes:** Begin with minimal elements, gradually adding layers to build anticipation

---

### Verse 1 [8 lines]

**Syllable Pattern:** 8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8
**Rhyme Scheme:** AABB CCDD
**Function:** Establishes the protagonist's initial situation/state of mind
**Emotional State:** Contemplative, awakening, realizing potential

**Metatags:** `[Verse 1: Sultry Vocals]`

**Example Structure:**

```other
Woke up with vinyl in my veins (8A) [HOT SPOT - opening image]
Kaleidoscope behind my brain (8A)
No puppet strings control this dance (8B) [LINE PLUS THREE: con-trol-this]
I'm carving out my circumstance (8B) [LINE PLUS THREE: cir-cum-stance]

Silver reflections catch my eye (8C)
Fragments of self I've set aside (8C)
The rhythm pulses through concrete (8D)
My solo steps now feel complete (8D) [HOT SPOT - verse conclusion]
```

**Cliché Prevention:**

- Instead of: "Found my rhythm, found my light"
- Try: "Woke up with vinyl in my veins"
- Why: Replaces generic "finding" with specific tactile/auditory experience

---

### Pre-Chorus [4 lines]

**Syllable Pattern:** 8-8-8-8
**Rhyme Scheme:** AABB
**Function:** Builds tension before chorus release
**Emotional State:** Growing confidence, anticipation

**Metatags:** `[Pre-Chorus: Building Energy]`

**Example Structure:**

```other
Fractured light across the floor (8A)
I spin alone but crave no more (8A) [LINE PLUS THREE: crave-no-more]
Each beat reveals another face (8B)
My movements claim this sacred space (8B) [HOT SPOT - transition to chorus]
```

**Cliché Prevention:**

- Instead of: "Lights are shining, time to glow"

---

### Chorus [8 lines]

**Syllable Pattern:** 8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8
**Rhyme Scheme:** AAAA AAAA or AAAA BBBB
**Function:** Delivers main message/hook, most danceable section
**Emotional State:** Confident, liberated, celebratory

**Metatags:** `[Chorus: Full Energy]` or `[Chorus: Euphoric Release]`

Spinning through this velvet groove (8B)
Creating patterns, smooth and loose (8B) [HOT SPOT - chorus conclusion]
```

**Cliché Prevention:**

- Instead of: "Shining bright for all to see"
- Try: "I cultivate my own mystique"

**Notes:** Typically instrumental with possible vocal ad-libs or echoed chorus phrases

## Line Plus Three Implementation

### Definition

Line Plus Three is a technique where a line concludes with a cluster of three syllables/beats that creates a rhythmic hook. These three-syllable endings often create the most memorable parts of your chorus.

### Key Placements

1. **Chorus:** Essential here for maximum hook impact
    - Example: "Velvet petals, sharp tech-nique"
    - Example: "Dancing solo, unique phy-sique"
1. **Verse Endings:** Create anticipation for section changes
    - Example: "No puppet strings con-trol-this"
    - Example: "I'm carving out cir-cum-stance"
1. **Bridge:** Helps maintain momentum
    - Example: "Now it's time to cel-e-brate"

### Effectiveness Tips

- Ensure the three syllables fall naturally in speech
- Place important words within the three-syllable group
- Keep consistent placement in parallel lines (especially chorus)
- Use strong consonants for the first syllable of the group for impact

## Emotional Arc Development

1. **Verse 1:** Awakening/Realization (40% energy)
2. **Pre-Chorus 1:** Building anticipation (60% energy)
3. **Chorus 1:** Confident assertion (90% energy)
4. **Verse 2:** Embracing power (50% energy)
5. **Pre-Chorus 2:** Intensifying (70% energy)
6. **Chorus 2:** Celebration (90% energy)
7. **Bridge:** Reflective revelation (70% energy)
8. **Final Chorus:** Triumphant culmination (100% energy)

## Cliché Prevention Checklist

### Common Disco/Dance Clichés to Avoid

- "Dancing all night long"
- "Feeling the rhythm/beat"
- "Lights flashing"
- "Heart beating"
- "Burning up the floor"
- "Moving to the groove"
- "Let the music take control"
- "Lost in the music"
- "Set me free"
- "Feel the fire/heat"

### Replacements Strategy

1. **Specificity:** Replace general terms with specific details
    - Instead of "lights" → "fractured projections" or "prism refractions"
    - Instead of "beat" → "bassline pressure" or "percussive pulse"
1. **Unexpected Combinations:** Pair contrasting concepts
    - "Velvet thunder" instead of "loud beat"
    - "Electric whisper" instead of "soft music"
1. **Tactile Over Visual:** Emphasize physical sensation
    - "Vinyl in my veins" instead of "music in my heart"
    - "Rhythm radiating through ribs" instead of "feeling the beat"
1. **Technical Language:** Use genre-specific terminology
    - "Four-on-the-floor foundation" instead of "steady beat"
    - "Filter sweeping" instead of "changing sound"
1. **Personal Over Universal:** Make it uniquely yours
    - "My signature frequency" instead of "my special style"
    - "Choreographing my code" instead of "dancing my way"

## Pre-Writing Exercise

Before drafting, complete this exercise:

1. List 5 specific sensory experiences related to dance/music:
    - Example: Feeling bass vibrations in your chest
    - Example: Condensation droplets falling from ceiling in crowded venue
1. Create 3 unique metaphors for self-expression:
    - Example: "I'm a switchboard operator connecting disparate circuits"
    - Example: "Calibrating personal algorithms with each precise step"
1. Choose 3 unexpected words from different domains to incorporate:
    - Example: Technical: "recalibrate," "algorithm," "frequency"
    - Example: Natural: "crystallize," "geode," "ecosystem"
1. Create your own "Line Plus Three" combinations:
    - Example: "cal-i-brate" (recalibrate my moves)
    - Example: "ver-i-fy" (steps I verify)
