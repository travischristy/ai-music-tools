# Template 4: Indie Folk Narrative Structure

## Core Concept

**Theme: Personal History and Place Connection**
This template creates a narrative-driven folk song exploring connections to places, memories, and personal history. The structure prioritizes storytelling and imagery, with a natural, conversational delivery that avoids folk clichés while maintaining authenticity.

## Structure Breakdown

### Intro [8 bars]

**Function:** Establishes acoustic foundation and mood
**Metatags:** `[Intro: Gentle Acoustic]` or `[Intro: Fingerpicked Pattern]`
**Notes:** Often features the core guitar pattern that will underpin the verses

---

### Verse 1 [8 lines]

**Syllable Pattern:** 10-8-10-8-10-8-10-8
**Rhyme Scheme:** ABCB DEFE
**Function:** Establishes setting and narrative beginning
**Emotional State:** Observational, reflective, scene-setting

**Metatags:** `[Verse 1: Storytelling Vocals]`

**Example Structure:**

```other
The hemlock trees lean over Baxter's Creek (10A) [HOT SPOT - specific place]
Where rust-red water flows (8B)
A hand-carved bench with initials speak (10C)
Of names that no one knows (8B) [LINE PLUS THREE: no-one-knows]

My grandfather's boots left imprints here (10D)
Through five decades of snow (8E)
The creaking porch boards still interfere (10F) [LINE PLUS THREE: in-ter-fere]
With thoughts I can't let go (8E) [HOT SPOT - personal connection]
```

**Cliché Prevention:**

- Instead of: "The winding river flows along"
- Try: "The hemlock trees lean over Baxter's Creek"
- Why: Uses specific tree type and named location rather than generic nature imagery

---

### Chorus [4 lines]

**Syllable Pattern:** 10-10-10-10
**Rhyme Scheme:** AABB
**Function:** Delivers thematic meaning and emotional core
**Emotional State:** Reflective, insightful, emotionally resonant

**Metatags:** `[Chorus: Warm Harmonies]`

**Example Structure:**

```other
These floorboards hold the footsteps of my past (10A) [HOT SPOT - main theme]
Each splinter, nail, and knothole built to last (10A) [LINE PLUS THREE: built-to-last]
I catalog the fingerprints we leave (10B)
On everything we touch but can't retrieve (10B) [HOT SPOT - philosophical point]
```

**Cliché Prevention:**

- Instead of: "Time goes by but memories remain"
- Try: "These floorboards hold the footsteps of my past"
- Why: Tangible metaphor using specific architectural element rather than abstract time concept

---

### Verse 2 [8 lines]

**Syllable Pattern:** 10-8-10-8-10-8-10-8
**Rhyme Scheme:** ABCB DEFE
**Function:** Advances narrative, adds detail and complexity
**Emotional State:** More emotionally engaged, developing story

**Metatags:** `[Verse 2: Detailed Narrative]`

**Example Structure:**

```other
The kitchen table's scratches tell the tale (10A)
Of Sunday card game nights (8B)
My mother's recipe cards growing pale (10C) [LINE PLUS THREE: grow-ing-pale]
Beneath the changing lights (8B) [HOT SPOT - time passage]

The radio still catches AM waves (10D)
From stations long dissolved (8E)
The calendar from '85 still saves (10F) [LINE PLUS THREE: still-saves]
A date we never solved (8E) [HOT SPOT - mystery element]
```

**Cliché Prevention:**

- Instead of: "Memories of days gone by"
- Try: "The kitchen table's scratches tell the tale"
- Why: Specific household object with visible history rather than generic memory reference

---

### Bridge [6 lines]

**Syllable Pattern:** 12-10-12-10-12-10
**Rhyme Scheme:** AABBCC
**Function:** Shifts perspective, provides insight or revelation
**Emotional State:** Revelatory, meditative, philosophical

**Metatags:** `[Bridge: Contemplative Shift]`

**Example Structure:**

```other
We document our histories in unexpected ways (12A) [HOT SPOT - philosophical opening]
In keepsakes too mundane to save (10A)
The coffee stain, the door frame marking height and days (12B) [LINE PLUS THREE: height-and-days]
The records we no longer play (10B) [LINE PLUS THREE: long-er-play]

The archaeology of ordinary lives revealed (12C)
In artifacts our hands have sealed (10C) [HOT SPOT - bridge conclusion]
```

**Cliché Prevention:**

- Instead of: "Time teaches us the lessons we must learn"
- Try: "We document our histories in unexpected ways"
- Why: More specific observation about how history is preserved rather than generic wisdom about time

---

### Verse 3 [8 lines]

**Syllable Pattern:** 10-8-10-8-10-8-10-8
**Rhyme Scheme:** ABCB DEFE
**Function:** Resolves narrative, brings story to conclusion

Through seasons, storms, and drought (8B)
The photographs with edges worn and frayed (10C) [LINE PLUS THREE: worn-and-frayed]
Tell stories still devout (8B) [HOT SPOT - emotional resonance]

My daughter's hands now trace the same carved wood (10D)
Her questions echo mine (8E)
She's learning how these patterns understood (10F) [LINE PLUS THREE: un-der-stood]
Transcend the span of time (8E) [HOT SPOT - generational connection]
```

**Cliché Prevention:**

- Instead of: "The circle of life continues on"
- Try: "My daughter's hands now trace the same carved wood"
- Why: Specific action showing continuity through generations rather than abstract circle metaphor

### Final Chorus [6 lines]

**Syllable Pattern:** 10-10-10-10-10-10

I catalog the fingerprints we leave (10B)
On everything we touch but can't retrieve (10B)

The evidence of living etches deep (10C) [HOT SPOT - new insight]
In vessels ordinary, strong, and keep (10C) [HOT SPOT - final wisdom]
```

### Outro [8 bars]

**Function:** Gentle conclusion, often instrumental reference to verse melody
**Metatags:** `[Outro: Acoustic Fade]` or `[Outro: Gentle Conclusion]`
**Notes:** May include soft humming or wordless vocals

## Line Plus Three Implementation

### Definition

In folk music, Line Plus Three should feel conversational and natural, often at the end of narrative statements. The technique works best when it sounds like natural speech with a subtle rhythmic emphasis.

### Key Placements

1. **End of Narrative Lines:** Conclude story segments
    - Example: "A hand-carved bench with initials speak of names that no-one-knows"
    - Example: "The creaking porch boards still in-ter-fere"
1. **Philosophical Moments:** Emphasize wisdom or insight
    - Example: "Each splinter, nail, and knothole built-to-last"
    - Example: "On everything we touch but can't re-trieve"
1. **Timeless Images:** Highlight enduring elements
    - Example: "The coffee stain, the door frame marking height-and-days"
    - Example: "The photographs with edges worn-and-frayed"

### Effectiveness Tips

- Keep Line Plus Three subtle and conversational in folk
- Place emphasis on words that carry narrative weight
- Use on lines that connect past to present
- Ensure the three syllables land naturally in speech

## Emotional Arc Development

1. **Verse 1:** Establishing place and history (30% emotional intensity)
2. **Chorus 1:** Reflective insight on meaning (50% intensity)
3. **Verse 2:** Deepening narrative with details (40% intensity)
4. **Bridge:** Philosophical reflection/perspective shift (70% intensity)
5. **Verse 3:** Narrative resolution with generational continuity (60% intensity)
6. **Final Chorus:** Wisdom and acceptance (80% intensity)
7. **Outro:** Peaceful conclusion (40% intensity, gradually fading)

## Cliché Prevention Checklist

### Common Folk Clichés to Avoid

- "Rivers flowing"
- "Mountains standing tall"
- "Dusty roads"
- "Weary traveler"
- "Time slipping away"
- "Changing seasons"
- "Simple life"
- "Small town ways"
- "Old oak tree"
- "Faded memories"

### Replacements Strategy

1. **Specific Geography:** Name actual places and features
    - Instead of "the mountains" → "Blackrock Ridge" or "the limestone bluffs"
    - Instead of "the river" → "Baxter's Creek" or "the north fork tributary"
1. **Precise Objects:** Use specific items with character
    - Instead of "old furniture" → "the cedar hope chest with brass hinges"
    - Instead of "family heirlooms" → "grandmother's blue willow teacups"
1. **Unusual Sensory Details:** Focus on overlooked sensations
    - Instead of "smell of pine" → "creosote scent from railway ties"
    - Instead of "autumn leaves" → "persimmon pulp on frost-cracked concrete"
1. **Technological Timemarks:** Use era-specific references
    - Instead of "years ago" → "when transistor radios caught distant signals"
    - Instead of "childhood" → "Super 8 footage without sound"
1. **Architectural Elements:** Reference specific structural details
    - Instead of "old house" → "porch with tongue-and-groove floorboards"
    - Instead of "family home" → "clapboard siding with lead paint layers"

## Pre-Writing Exercise

Before drafting, complete this exercise:

1. Create 5 specific place details from a meaningful location:
    - Example: Type of trees (eastern hemlock, sugar maple)
    - Example: Named features (Sawyer's Ridge, Mineral Creek)
    - Example: Architectural details (hand-hewn beams, mortise-and-tenon joints)
    - Example: Weather patterns (August thunderheads, January ice storms)
    - Example: Local wildlife (barred owls, brook trout)
1. List 5 household objects that tell a story:
    - Example: Kitchen items (cast-iron skillet, blue enamel percolator)
    - Example: Tools (cross-cut saw with worn handle, hand drill)
    - Example: Furniture (rocker with replaced spindles, drop-leaf table)
    - Example: Documents (property deed from 1923, handwritten recipe cards)
    - Example: Textiles (quilt with tobacco sack patches, darned wool socks)
1. Identify 3 generational connections to explore:
    - Example: "Grandfather's hands and my daughter's share the same knuckles"
    - Example: "The skill of grafting apple trees passed down three generations"
    - Example: "Names repeated through birth certificates spanning a century"
1. Create 3 metaphors for the passage of time using household objects:
    - Example: "Wallpaper layers like geological strata"
    - Example: "Door hinges marking seasons in squeaks and groans"
    - Example: "Window glass, wavy with gravity's slow persistence"

## Suno-Specific Implementation Notes

### Style Input Example (Max 200 characters)

```other
acoustic indie folk, intimate male vocals with subtle harmonies, fingerpicked guitar, minimal upright bass, occasional ambient pedal steel, organic recording aesthetic, natural reverb
```

### Metatag Placement

- For folk, emphasize storytelling aspects in metatags
- Keep production references organic and acoustic
- Focus on vocal authenticity rather than technical precision
- Allow space for natural breath and phrasing

### Character Limits

- Style input: 200 characters maximum
- Lyrics: 3000 characters maximum
- Consider longer narrative sections with fewer choruses for story-driven songs

### Final Quality Check

- Confirm narrative progression is clear and emotionally resonant
- Verify syllable counts maintain natural, conversational flow
- Ensure all imagery is specific and avoids genre clichés
- Check that geographical and historical references feel authentic
- Validate emotional arc builds to meaningful insight
- Confirm generational connections feel genuine and earned
